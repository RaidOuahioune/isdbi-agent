VIOLATIONS:

*   **FAS 7: Profit Allocation Between Owners and Investment Account Holders:** The basis and method of profit distribution to investment account holders (e.g., Mudarabah ratio) are not disclosed.
*   **FAS 32: Ijarah:** Ijarah assets are reported as operating leases without proper justification or disclosure of whether they meet the criteria to be considered Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek or other forms of Ijarah that would be treated differently. The wording implies all Ijarah are being treated as operating leases when they may not be.
* **FAS 28: Disclosure on Islamic Financing and Investment Assets:** The financing data is aggregated (Murabaha, Ijarah, Istisna) instead of disaggregated into more detailed sub-categories based on customer segment, maturity, etc. for better transparency.
