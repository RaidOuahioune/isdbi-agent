VIOLATIONS:

*   FAS 7: Omission of the specific profit-sharing ratio applied between the bank and Investment Account Holders (IAH) within the statement of income and related notes. The note vaguely mentions "Profits are shared with account holders" but provides no quantitative details.
*   FAS 32: Ijarah assets may be misreported. Note 5 refers to "assets leased under Ijarah contracts" and then discusses depreciation - this could indicate they are being treated as operating leases from a lessor perspective instead of financial leases, where the asset stays on the bank's balance sheet.
*   FAS 28: Financing data is aggregated, and no mention of individual financing instrument breakdowns of the Real Estate, Trade Finance, Personal Finance, and Other categories, thus limiting transparency.
