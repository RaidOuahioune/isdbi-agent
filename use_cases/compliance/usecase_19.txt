- VIOLATIONS:

1.  **FAS 10 (Istisna and Parallel Istisna):** No mention of whether the Istisna' assets involve parallel Istisna'. This lack of disclosure obscures the bank's potential exposure to risks associated with parallel structures.

2.  **FAS 28 (Disclosure on Islamic Financing and Investment Assets):** The Financing Activities section (Note 2) aggregates Murabaha, Salam, Istisna’, and Ijarah, rather than providing separate details for each type of financing. The details of income generated from the activities are shown in the Income Statement, but there is not a clear overview of the volume of each Financing product within the financial statement.

3.  **FAS 32 (Ijarah):** Note 5 states that Ijarah assets transfer all risks and rewards of ownership, implying a finance lease, but these are reported as Operating Leases within the balance sheet.
