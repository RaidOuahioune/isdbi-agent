- VIOLATIONS:
1.  **FAS 7: Profit Allocation Between Owners and Investment Account Holders:** The report omits the profit-sharing basis (e.g., Mudarabah ratio) between the bank and investment account holders. Note 6 mentions Investment Accounts, but does not specify any sharing ratio.
2.  **FAS 10: Istisna and Parallel Istisna:** The report mentions Istisna' Assets in the balance sheet and income statement, but there is no disclosure on whether any of these transactions involved Parallel Istisna'. Such disclosure is required for transparency.
3. **FAS 28: Disclosure on Islamic Financing and Investment Assets** The Bank has aggregated all financings provided in Note 7. Detailed breakdowns of the various types of financings are not given.
4.  **FAS 32: Ijarah:** Note 4 says "The bank treats these as operating leases." This implies that the Ijarah assets are treated as operating leases when, in reality, they are likely to be finance leases (Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek), which is a direct violation.
