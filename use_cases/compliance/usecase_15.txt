- VIOLATIONS:
```
[
    {
        "Standard": "FAS 28: Disclosure on Islamic Financing and Investment Assets",
        "Violation": "Aggregated rather than disaggregated financing data. The report lumps all financing assets (Murabaha, Istisna', Ijarah) together without providing a breakdown by sector, maturity, or geographical location. This limits transparency.",
        "Justification": "Murabaha, Istisna' and Ijarah are shown as a single line in the Balance Sheet, instead of the required disaggregation."
    },
    {
       "Standard": "FAS 32: Ijarah",
       "Violation": "Misreporting of Ijarah assets as operating leases. Note 4 classifies Ijarah assets solely as 'operating lease arrangements.' This can hide the fact that these could be Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek (lease to ownership) where the ownership will eventually transfer to the customer. It is important to show the financial leases separately and operating leases separately.",
       "Justification": "Ijarah is classified as operating lease, while there could be Financial Leases hidden in it"
    },
    {
        "Standard": "FAS 7: Profit Allocation Between Owners and Investment Account Holders",
        "Violation": "Omission of profit-sharing basis for investment accounts. While note 6 mentions a 'pre-agreed percentage,' it fails to specify the actual profit-sharing ratio between the bank and the investment account holders. This is essential for transparency and ensuring fairness.",
        "Justification": "Profit sharing ratios are not explicitely mentioned"
    }
