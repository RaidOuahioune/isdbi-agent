VIOLATIONS:

*   **FAS 7: Profit Allocation Between Owners and Investment Account Holders**: Note 6 mentions that investment accounts are based on Mudarabah principles but omits details about the profit-sharing ratio between the bank (Mudarib) and the investment account holders (Rab-ul-Maal).
*   **FAS 32: Ijarah**: Note 4 states that "Ijarah Assets: Represents assets held under lease agreements. These are being accounted for as operating leases." Ijarah assets should be classified and treated in accordance with AAOIFI guidance on Ijarah, which generally treats them more akin to finance leases than operating leases.
*   **FAS 28: Disclosure on Islamic Financing and Investment Assets**: Note 9 states that "Total value of financing and investment assets are 75,000". It should be disaggregated per type, namely Murabaha, Istisna, and Ijarah assets.
