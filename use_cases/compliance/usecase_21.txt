2.  **FAS 32: Ijarah:** The nature of Ijarah assets isn't clear. If it's Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek (hire purchase), it should be disclosed and not simply booked as an operating lease as implied.
3.  **FAS 28: Disclosure on Islamic Financing and Investment Assets:** The financing portfolio should ideally be disaggregated into more granular detail (e.g., by sector, maturity) rather than simply presenting aggregate figures.
