End of Report
VIOLATIONS:

*   **FAS 10: Istisna and Parallel Istisna:**  Note 3 mentions *Istisna Assets*, but there's no disclosure of the use of, or accounting for, parallel Istisna' arrangements, which are often used in larger construction projects.
*   **FAS 32: Ijarah:** Note 4 classifies *Ijarah Assets* as *operating leases*. According to FAS 32, these are typically *finance leases*, where the bank transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. This is a misclassification.
*   **FAS 4: General Presentation and Disclosure:** Note 7 contains a very generic statement regarding the Shari'ah Board. There are no details or specifics regarding the board's composition, responsibilities, or the nature of their reviews of bank activities and products. A statement like this is not detailed enough.
