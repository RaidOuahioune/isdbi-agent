VIOLATIONS:

*   **FAS 7 (Profit Allocation Between Owners and Investment Account Holders):** Note 5 only vaguely states "profits are allocated based on a pre-agreed ratio" but provides no details on the ratio. Specific profit-sharing percentages (e.g., Mudarabah ratio or Wakalah fee) are absent, failing to give Investment Account Holders full disclosure.
*   **FAS 32 (Ijarah):** Note 3 misreports Ijarah assets as operating leases. Under Shari'ah, Ijarah contracts that transfer ownership at the end of the lease term must be treated as finance leases. This misclassification impacts the recognition of revenue, depreciation, and asset classification.
*   **FAS 28 (Disclosure on Islamic Financing and Investment Assets):** The Bank presented aggregated financing data rather than disaggregated. The report presents only total Murabaha, Ijarah and Istisna' amounts. However, there are no breakdowns related to tenor, industry sector, or geographic location.
