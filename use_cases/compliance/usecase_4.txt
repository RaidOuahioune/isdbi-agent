The Bank's performance was driven by growth in Murabaha and Ijarah financing activities.

VIOLATIONS:

*   **FAS 7: Profit Allocation Between Owners and Investment Account Holders:** Note 5 states profits are distributed based on "the bank's overall performance," lacking specific details on the profit-sharing ratio (PSR) and the allocation methodology between the bank and investment account holders.

*   **FAS 32: Ijarah:** Note 3 states, "These leases are classified as operating leases." This misclassification is a violation if these Ijarah assets are in fact *financed leases* and should be reported as such.

*   **FAS 28: Disclosure on Islamic Financing and Investment Assets:** The Balance Sheet itemizes *types* of financing (Murabaha, Istisna, Ijarah), but these are not disaggregated by *sector*. The disclosure could be improved with a breakdown of financing by sector, such as real estate, manufacturing, and consumer finance.
