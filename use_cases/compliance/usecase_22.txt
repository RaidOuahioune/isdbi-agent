VIOLATIONS:

*   **FAS 32: Ijarah:** "The bank retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of these assets and accounts for these leases as operating leases." This implies that the Ijarah assets are being treated as operating leases, which is incorrect. Ijarah assets are specifically finance leases, and should be recognised with the corresponding obligations.
*   **FAS 28: Disclosure on Islamic Financing and Investment Assets:** Financing data is aggregated, rather than disaggregated by product type.
*   **FAS 4: General Presentation and Disclosure:** The note relating to the Shari'ah supervisory board only mentions they review transactions but doesnâ€™t provide any commentary or assurance regarding compliance.
