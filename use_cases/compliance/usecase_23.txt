### Notes to the Condensed Interim Financial Statements

2.  **Murabaha Receivables:** Represents amounts due from customers under Murabaha financing agreements.

3.  **Ijarah Assets:** Consists of properties held under lease agreements. These are treated as operating leases for accounting purposes, with rental income recognized over the lease term.

4.  **Istisna' Assets:** Represents the cost of construction of assets under Istisna' contracts, less progress billings.

5.  **Investment Accounts:** These are profit-sharing investment accounts held by customers. The profit distribution rate is based on the bank's overall profitability.

### Management's Discussion and Analysis
The Bank recorded a Net Profit of $2.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, an increase of 19% compared to the same period last year. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in financing activities and efficient cost management. The bank remains committed to providing Shari'ah-compliant financial solutions and delivering value to its stakeholders.

- VIOLATIONS:

*   **FAS 7:**  Note 5 mentions profit distribution for Investment Accounts is "based on the bank's overall profitability," but the specific *profit-sharing ratio* (e.g., Mudarabah ratio) is not disclosed. The omission of the ratio is a violation of FAS 7, which requires clear disclosure of the basis and ratios for profit allocation between the bank and investment account holders.
*   **FAS 32:** Note 3 incorrectly categorizes Ijarah assets as operating leases. In Islamic finance, Ijarah (leasing) is typically treated as a *finance lease* if the risks and rewards of ownership are substantially transferred to the lessee. The description violates FAS 32 by misreporting the economic substance of Ijarah transactions.
*   **FAS 10:** Note 4 describes the Istisna' assets, but fails to disclose whether any parallel Istisna' transactions are being utilized. Parallel Istisna' is a common practice, and AAOIFI standards require its disclosure.
