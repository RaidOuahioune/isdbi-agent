- VIOLATIONS:
```
*   FAS 7: Omission of profit-sharing basis for investment accounts (Note 6 only mentions "returns are distributed periodically" without specifying the profit-sharing ratio or mechanism).
*   FAS 32: Misreporting of Ijarah assets as operating leases (Note 3 mentions "operating lease agreements" but Ijarah is a form of Islamic financing lease, so it should be a financing lease rather than an operating lease under conventional accounting).
* FAS 28: Aggregated rather than disaggregated financing data (The SOFP consolidates all financings in large groupings and doesn’t break down by each financing type.)
