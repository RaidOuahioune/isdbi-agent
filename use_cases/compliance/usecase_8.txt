VIOLATIONS:
```
- FAS 7: The basis for profit allocation between owners and investment account holders (e.g., Mudarabah, Wakala) is not disclosed in the notes or anywhere in the statement.
- FAS 32: Ijarah assets are classified as operating leases instead of correctly reflecting their nature as finance leases, resulting in an understatement of assets and liabilities. This is implied as no distinction between finance and operating lease is made.
- FAS 28: Financing data is aggregated into broad categories like "Murabaha Receivables" without providing a disaggregated view based on sector, maturity, or credit quality.
