**Statement from the Shari’ah Supervisory Board:**

The Shari’ah Supervisory Board has reviewed the operations of the bank for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and confirms that, to the best of its knowledge, the bank has complied with Shari’ah principles in its material operations.

VIOLATIONS:

*   **FAS 7:** The specific profit-sharing ratios for the Investment Accounts (Mudaraba and Wakala) are not explicitly disclosed in Note 3.
*   **FAS 32:** Note 4 states that *Ijarah* assets are treated as operating leases, which is often incorrect for *Ijarah Muntahia Bit Tamleek* (lease-to-own), which are technically a form of financing.
*   **FAS 28:** Aggregated financing data is presented in the Balance Sheet. There are no further details (such as maturity or sector) disclosed in a separate note.
