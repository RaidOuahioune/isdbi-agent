- VIOLATIONS:
    - FAS 7: Omission of the profit-sharing basis/ratio for investment accounts (Note 5).
    - FAS 28: Aggregated reporting of Islamic financing assets (Murabaha, Ijara, Istisna) without disaggregation by type of customer or industry.
    - FAS 32: Ijara Assets are mentioned in Note 2, but there is no discussion of whether these are treated as finance leases (Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek) or operating leases and no mention of the associated accounting treatment. It is stated that the Bank acts as the lessor, and the lease terms typically range from 3 to 5 years. This is not enough information to properly ascertain whether the bank is in compliance.
