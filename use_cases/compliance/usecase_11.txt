- VIOLATIONS:
1. **FAS 7:** Omission of profit-sharing basis for investment accounts. Note 6 mentions that investment accounts are profit-sharing, but it fails to mention the exact ratio used to allocate profits between the bank and the investment account holders.

2. **FAS 32:** Misreporting of Ijarah assets as operating leases. Note 3 incorrectly states "These are classified as operating leases." Under AAOIFI standards, Ijarah assets should be recognized as finance leases (unless they meet very specific exceptions) if the bank is substantially bearing the risks and rewards of ownership.

3. **FAS 4:** Limited Shari'ah Board Commentary. Note 7 mentions the board and its role in broad terms but does not provide any specific comments or activities undertaken by the Shari'ah Board during the reporting period. This violates FAS 4's requirement for adequate disclosure of the Shari'ah Board's role and opinions.
