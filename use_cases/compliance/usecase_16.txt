2.  **Significant Accounting Policies:** The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

3.  **Ijarah Assets:** Ijarah assets consist primarily of real estate held for leasing to customers under operating lease agreements. The Bank retains ownership of these assets.

4.  **Shari'ah Supervisory Board:** The Shari'ah Supervisory Board reviews the Bank's operations periodically to ensure compliance with Shari'ah principles.

5.  **Related Party Transactions:** There were no significant related party transactions during the quarter.

6.  **Financing Activities:** The bank provides financing based on Murabaha, Istisna' and Ijarah contracts.

**[End of Report]**

**VIOLATIONS:**

*   **FAS 7: Profit Allocation Between Owners and Investment Account Holders:** The report does not disclose the specific profit-sharing ratio or method used for allocating profits between the bank's shareholders and the investment account holders.
*   **FAS 28: Disclosure on Islamic Financing and Investment Assets:** The financing data is aggregated (Murabaha, Istisna', Ijarah contracts are summarized as "Financing activities") instead of being disaggregated by type, sector, and maturity.
*   **FAS 32: Ijarah:** Note 3 states that Ijarah assets are under operating leases, which might be misrepresenting the true nature of the Ijarah contracts. Under AAOIFI standards, Ijarah generally should be considered finance leases, not operating leases, as the bank is recovering the cost of the asset and earning a profit margin.
