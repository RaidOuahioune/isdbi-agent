VIOLATIONS:

*   **FAS 32 (Ijarah):** Note 3 states, "These are treated as operating leases." Islamic Ijarah is a financing lease, not an operating lease, and this misclassification affects how the asset and related income are accounted for.
*   **FAS 28 (Disclosure on Islamic Financing and Investment Assets):** The balance sheet provides aggregated data on financing assets (Murabaha, Ijarah, Istisna’). There is no disaggregation by type of customer (e.g., retail, corporate) or industry sector, limiting the understanding of the bank's financing portfolio.
