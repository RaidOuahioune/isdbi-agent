**Note Regarding Investment Account Holders (IAH)**

The bank manages investment accounts as Mudarabah investments. Profits from these accounts are distributed according to the terms and conditions agreed with the IAH. These accounts represent an important source of funding for the bank's Islamic financing activities.
---
VIOLATIONS:

1.  **FAS 7: Profit Allocation Between Owners and Investment Account Holders:** The report mentions "distribution to Investment Account Holders" but doesn't specify the *basis* of profit sharing. I.e., what percentage of profit is given to the IAH, and how is this percentage determined, or justified. This information is required under FAS 7.

2.  **FAS 10: Istisna and Parallel Istisna:** The report mentions Istisna' assets, however, it provides no detail or disclosure if parallel Istisna' was used, which is common in project financing. If parallel Istisna' was used, this should be disclosed. The value of Istisna Assets in the Financing Portfolio Analysis does not match the Istisna Assets in the Balance Sheet.

3.  **FAS 32: Ijarah:** Ijarah assets are classified as operating leases, but in Islamic finance, Ijarah assets usually involve the transfer of ownership at the end of the lease term or a purchase option, which would make them *finance leases*, not operating leases. The treatment of Ijarah assets under operating leases will impact the financial reporting. The notes also do not contain any explicit discussion of how the Ijarah transactions meet Sharia compliance.
