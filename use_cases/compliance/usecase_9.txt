VIOLATIONS:

*   **Violation of FAS 32 (Ijarah):** Note 3 explicitly states "accounted for as operating leases." True *Ijarah* assets should be treated as finance leases under AAOIFI standards, recognizing assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
*   **Violation of FAS 28 (Disclosure on Islamic Financing and Investment Assets):** The presentation aggregates various types of financing (Murabaha, Ijara, Istisna') without providing a disaggregated view of the characteristics of each financing type, such as tenor or sector concentration.
