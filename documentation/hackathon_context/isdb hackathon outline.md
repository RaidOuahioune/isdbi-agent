Hackathon Title
Strengthening the Adoption of Standards in Islamic Finance with Artificial Intelligence

1. Problem Statement and objective
AI-powered solutions tailored to make the selected AAOIFI Financial Accounting
Standards (FAS) easier to implement and adopt, more comprehensive, user-friendly and
globally compatible, leading to higher compliance rates and better financial decisionmaking in the Islamic Finance sector.
2. Deliverables
• Working AI powered solution/prototype
• Detailed documentation including technical architecture and specs as well as
clear presentation of the solution (a high resolution video of max 10 minutes
providing a clear walkthrough of all scenarios: briefly on the first three
categories, and thoroughly on the fourth category).
3. Pre-requisites
Workshop from Ubility on the AI platform to be used
Workshop from IsDBI on the 5 selected AAOIFI FAS (4, 7, 10, 28 and 32)
The 5 selected AAOIFI FAS and their corresponding AAOIFI SS (Shariah Standards)
N.B. The two workshops are recorded, and the recording were communicated to all
teams.
4. Evaluation Criteria
• Accuracy
• Reusability and Scalability
• Technical Specifications
• Innovation
• Presentation and Communication
5. Milestones
Online phase (8-10 May)
Shortlisting to 10 finalists plus feedback (11-14 May)
Onsite phase (15-17 May)

Challenges Set
The set includes the following categories:
1. Use case scenarios: This includes the scenario of the use case at hand, the related
question, as well as the provided correct answer, so that the AI solution can bridge the
gap between the AI generated answers and the provided correct answer.
2. Reverse transactions: This includes some “out-of-context” financial entries from which
the relevant FAS are to be induced. The provided correct answer is given so that the AI
solution can fix any gap and discrepancy.
3. Standard enhancement: In this category, teams need to demonstrate how AI can be
used to review, suggest, and validate updates or clarifications to a selected AAOIFI
standard. The team need to design a system using a multi-agent architecture with clear
segregation of duties, including (but not limited to):
o A(n) agent(s) responsible for reviewing the standard and extracting key
elements.
o A(n) agent(s) tasked with proposing AI-driven modifications or enhancements to
the Standards.
o One or more agents for validating and approving the proposed changes based
on compliance logic, contextual understanding, and alignment with Shariah
principles.
Expected Outcome:
A functional prototype or conceptual model that illustrates how AI agents interact to
enhance the standard effectively, ensuring both compliance and practical applicability
within the Islamic finance framework.
4. Teams own category: Based on the skills developed for the previous categories, teams
are to develop a working prototype (as proof of concept) of an AI-powered tool that can
serve one or more of the following objectives (or any other similar objective they would
like to enhance):

- Financial Product Design
- Audit
- Fraud and ML detection
- Cross-Border (Multi-Jurisdictional) Compliance Advisor

1. Use case scenarios category
Ijarah MBT Accounting (in Lessee’s books)
On 1 January 2019 Alpha Islamic bank (Lessee) entered into an Ijarah MBT arrangement with
Super Generators for Ijarah of a heavy-duty generator purchase by Super Generators at a price
of USD 450,000.
Super Generators has also paid USD 12,000 as import tax and US 30,000 for freight charges.
The Ijarah Term is 02 years and expected residual value at the end USD 5,000. At the end of
Ijarah Term, it is highly likely that the option of transfer of ownership of the underlying asset to
the lessee shall be exercised through purchase at a price of USD 3,000.
Alpha Islamic Bank will amortize the ‘right of use’ on yearly basis and it is required to pay yearly
rental of USD 300,000.
Provide the following accounting entry in the books of Alpha Islamic Bank:
Initial Recognition at the time of commencement of Ijarah (using Underlying Asset Cost
Method).hin the Islamic finance framework.

1. Use case scenarios category
Ijarah MBT Accounting (in Lessee’s books)
On 1 January 2019 Alpha Islamic bank (Lessee) entered into an Ijarah MBT arrangement with
Super Generators for Ijarah of a heavy-duty generator purchase by Super Generators at a price
of USD 450,000.
Super Generators has also paid USD 12,000 as import tax and US 30,000 for freight charges.
The Ijarah Term is 02 years and expected residual value at the end USD 5,000. At the end of
Ijarah Term, it is highly likely that the option of transfer of ownership of the underlying asset to
the lessee shall be exercised through purchase at a price of USD 3,000.
Alpha Islamic Bank will amortize the ‘right of use’ on yearly basis and it is required to pay yearly
rental of USD 300,000.
Provide the following accounting entry in the books of Alpha Islamic Bank:
Initial Recognition at the time of commencement of Ijarah (using Underlying Asset Cost
Method).
Correct Solution:
Initial Recognition at the Time of Commencement of Ijarah (1 January 2019):
The cost of the underlying asset is the basis for recognizing the "Right of Use" (ROU) asset.
Determine the Right-of-Use Asset (ROU)
• Prime cost (Purchase + Import tax + Freight):
= 450,000 + 12,000 + 30,000 = 492,000
• Less: Terminal value (i.e., Purchase price of USD 3,000 to acquire ownership)
= 492,000 − 3,000 = 489,000 (ROU)
Add Deferred Ijarah Cost:
• Total rentals over 2 years = 300,000 × 2 = 600,000
• Less: Present value of ROU = 489,000
• Deferred Ijarah Cost = 600,000 − 489,000 = 111,000
Journal Entry:
Dr. Right of Use Asset (ROU) USD 489,000
Dr. Deferred Ijarah Cost) USD 111,000
 Cr. Ijarah Liability USD 600,000
Amortizable Amount Calculation
Description USD
Cost of ROU 489,000
Less: Terminal value difference (Residual 5,000 − Purchase 3,000) 2,000
Amortizable Amount 487,000
We deduct this 2,000 since the Lessee is expected to gain ownership, and this value will remain
in the books after the lease ends.
2. Reverse Transaction Category
Reverse transaction #1:
Context: GreenTech exits in Year 3, and Al Baraka Bank buys out its stake.
Adjustments:
Buyout Price: $1,750,000
Bank Ownership: 100%
Accounting Treatment:
Derecognition of GreenTech’s equity
Recognition of acquisition expense
Journal Entry for Buyout:
Dr. GreenTech Equity $1,750,000
 Cr. Cash $1,750,000
Challenge:
Can you identify the AAOIFI FAS applicable to these entries? If more than one is possible,
include weighted probability and reason
Correct Answer: Should list FAS 4 as highest weight, might include FAS 20 as second highest
weight then FAS 32 as third highest weight.
Reverse transaction #2:
Context: The client cancels the change order, reverting to the original contract terms.
Adjustments:
Revised Contract Value: Back to $5,000,000
Timeline Restored: 2 years
Accounting Treatment:
Adjustment of revenue and cost projections
Reversal of additional cost accruals
Journal Entry for Cost Reversal:
Dr. Accounts Payable $1,000,000
 Cr. Work-in-Progress $1,000,000
This restores the original contract cost.
Challenge:
Can you identify the AAOIFI FAS applicable to these entries? If more than one is possible,
include weighted probability and reason
Correct Answer: Should list FAS 10 as highest weight, and should not include FAS 8, FAS 19 or
FAS 23, if more than one standard is found possible.
3. Standards Enhancement
− FAS 4
− FAS 10
− FAS 32
The challenge related to this category is to demonstrate how AI can be used to review,
suggest, and validate updates or clarifications to a selected AAOIFI standard. The team need
to design a system using a multi-agent architecture with clear segregation of duties,
including (but not limited to):
o A(n) agent(s) responsible for reviewing the standard and extracting key
elements.
o A(n) agent(s) tasked with proposing AI-driven modifications or enhancements to
the Standards.
o One or more agents for validating and approving the proposed changes based
on compliance logic, contextual understanding, and alignment with Shariah
principles.
Expected Outcome:
A functional prototype or conceptual model that illustrates how AI agents interact to
enhance the standard effectively, ensuring both compliance and practical applicability
within the Islamic finance framework.
It is up to you to be creative in how to guarantee maximum accuracy and relevance from AI
updates, while displaying the reasoning and sources of each amendment proposed.
4. Teams Own Category
You need to come up with a new category of challenges, leveraging on the skills you developed

objective they would like to enhance):
• Financial Product Design
• Audit
• Fraud and ML detection
• Cross-Border (Multi-Jurisdictional) Compliance Advisor
