### Summary

*   **Islamic Financial Product Type:** Istisna'a
*   **Applicable AAOIFI Standard(s):** FAS 10 (Istisna'a and Parallel Istisna'a)
*   **Method Used:** Percentage-of-Completion Method

### Calculation Methodology

*   **Percentage of Completion:** (Costs incurred to date / Total estimated costs) * 100%
*   **Total Estimated Profit:** Contract Price - Total Estimated Costs
*   **Revenue Recognized for the Period:** Contract Price * Percentage of Completion
*   **Cost of Istisna'a Revenue for the Period:** Costs incurred during the period
*   **Profit Recognized for the Period:** Revenue Recognized - Cost of Istisna'a Revenue

#### Calculation

*   Costs incurred to date: USD 320,000
*   Total estimated costs: USD 800,000
*   Contract price: USD 1,000,000

1.  **Percentage of Completion:** (USD 320,000 / USD 800,000) * 100% = 40%
2.  **Total Estimated Profit:** USD 1,000,000 - USD 800,000 = USD 200,000
3.  **Revenue Recognized for the Period:** USD 1,000,000 * 40% = USD 400,000
4.  **Cost of Istisna'a Revenue for the Period:** USD 320,000
5.  **Profit Recognized for the Period:** USD 400,000 - USD 320,000 = USD 80,000
    *   *(Alternatively: USD 200,000 * 40% = USD 80,000)*
