Accounting Guidance:
**Islamic Financial Product Type:** Istisna'a

**Applicable AAOIFI Standard(s):** FAS 10: Istisna’a and Parallel Istisna’a

**Step-by-Step Calculation Methodology:**

1.  **Calculate Percentage of Completion:**
    *   Formula: (Costs Incurred to Date / Total Estimated Costs) * 100%
    *   Calculation: (USD 320,000 / USD 800,000) * 100% = 40%

2.  **Calculate Total Contract Profit:**
    *   Formula: Contract Price - Total Estimated Costs
    *   Calculation: USD 1,000,000 - USD 800,000 = USD 200,000

3.  **Calculate Revenue Recognized for the Period:**
    *   Formula: Contract Price * Percentage of Completion
    *   Calculation: USD 1,000,000 * 40% = USD 400,000

4.  **Calculate Cost of Revenue Recognized for the Period:**
    *   Formula: Total Estimated Costs * Percentage of Completion
    *   Calculation: USD 800,000 * 40% = USD 320,000
    *   (Alternatively, this equals Costs Incurred to Date)

5.  **Calculate Profit Recognized for the Period:**
    *   Formula: Revenue Recognized - Cost of Revenue Recognized
    *   Calculation: USD 400,000 - USD 320,000 = USD 80,000
    *   (Alternatively: Total Contract Profit * Percentage of Completion = USD 200,000 * 40% = USD 80,000)
