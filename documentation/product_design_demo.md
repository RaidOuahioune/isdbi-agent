# Financial Product Design Advisor - Demo Script

This document provides a step-by-step script for demonstrating the Financial Product Design Advisor feature (Challenge 4) during the hackathon presentation.

## Introduction (1-2 minutes)

"For Challenge 4, we've developed a Financial Product Design Advisor that helps Islamic finance professionals conceptualize new Shariah-compliant financial products. This advisor recommends appropriate Islamic contract structures based on specific requirements, highlights relevant AAOIFI FAS implications, and provides initial Shariah compliance considerations."

## Demo Overview (30 seconds)

"In this demo, I'll show how our advisor can help design three types of financial products:
1. A retail home financing solution
2. A business financing product for SMEs
3. An ethical investment fund

These examples represent common use cases in Islamic finance that require careful consideration of both financial and Shariah requirements."

## Demo 1: Islamic Home Financing (2-3 minutes)

"Let's start with a common need - designing a Shariah-compliant alternative to conventional mortgages."

### Setup
1. Navigate to the Product Design Advisor page
2. Fill in the form with the following details:
   - Product Objective: "Shariah-compliant home financing product competitive with conventional mortgages"
   - Risk Appetite: "Medium"
   - Investment Tenor: "Long-term (5+ years)"
   - Target Audience: "Retail investors"
   - Asset Focus: "Real estate"
   - Desired Features: "Asset-backed", "Fixed periodic payments", "Early termination option" 
   - Additional Notes: "Must be competitive with conventional mortgages in terms of cost and flexibility"

### Narration Points
- "For home financing, I'm specifying a medium risk appetite with long-term tenor, focusing on retail customers."
- "I've selected key features that home buyers typically look for, including fixed payments and early termination options."
- "The additional note emphasizes the need to be competitive with conventional products while maintaining Shariah compliance."

### Results Walkthrough
- "The advisor has recommended a Diminishing Musharakah structure for our home financing product."
- "Notice how the system provides a complete structural breakdown, including the parties involved, flow of funds, and ownership transfer mechanism."
- "The diagram visualizes how the bank and customer share ownership, with the customer gradually buying the bank's share over time."
- "In the AAOIFI Standards tab, we can see the key accounting considerations from FAS 4, which governs partnership arrangements."
- "The Shariah compliance section highlights critical checkpoints, including avoiding guaranteed returns and maintaining true asset ownership."

## Demo 2: SME Financing Solution (2-3 minutes)

"Now, let's design a product to address the working capital needs of small businesses."

### Setup
1. Navigate back to the design form
2. Fill in the form with the following details:
   - Product Objective: "Working capital financing for seasonal businesses"
   - Risk Appetite: "Medium"
   - Investment Tenor: "Medium-term (1-5 years)"
   - Target Audience: "SMEs"
   - Asset Focus: "No specific preference"
   - Desired Features: "Asset-backed", "Staged funding"
   - Additional Notes: "Needs to accommodate seasonal business cycles with variable cash flows"

### Narration Points
- "SMEs often need flexible financing that can adapt to seasonal business cycles."
- "I'm requesting staged funding as a key feature to match the variable cash flow needs."
- "This is a medium-risk product with a medium-term horizon."

### Results Walkthrough
- "The system has recommended a Murabaha structure, which is a cost-plus sale commonly used for SME financing."
- "The product structure shows how inventory or equipment can be purchased and sold to the business with a markup."
- "Looking at the AAOIFI Standards tab, we see FAS 28 guidelines for Murabaha transactions."
- "The Shariah compliance section highlights the importance of genuine sale transactions and avoiding disguised interest."
- "The implementation timeline provides concrete next steps for developing detailed terms and operational workflows."

## Demo 3: Ethical Investment Fund (2-3 minutes)

"Finally, let's design an ethical investment fund that combines Shariah compliance with modern ESG considerations."

### Setup
1. Navigate back to the design form
2. Fill in the form with the following details:
   - Product Objective: "Diversified ethical investment fund with ESG focus"
   - Risk Appetite: "Medium to High"
   - Investment Tenor: "Medium-term (1-5 years)"
   - Target Audience: "Retail investors"
   - Asset Focus: "Equity"
   - Desired Features: "Tradable/Securitizable", "Profit-sharing"
   - Additional Notes: "Focus on ethical screening and ESG factors alongside Shariah compliance"

### Narration Points
- "There's growing demand for investment options that address both Shariah requirements and environmental, social, and governance factors."
- "This product has a higher risk appetite since it's equity-focused."
- "I've specified that it should be tradable and include profit-sharing mechanisms."

### Results Walkthrough
- "The advisor has recommended a Mudarabah structure for our investment fund."
- "The structure clearly delineates the roles of fund managers and investors, with transparent profit-sharing."
- "The AAOIFI Standards tab highlights key accounting considerations from FAS 4."
- "The Shariah compliance section emphasizes the importance of ethical screening and avoiding prohibited activities."
- "Note how the implementation steps include developing both Shariah and ESG screening methodologies."

## Conclusion (1 minute)

"The Financial Product Design Advisor demonstrates how AI can assist Islamic finance professionals in:

1. Quickly conceptualizing new financial products aligned with both market needs and Shariah requirements
2. Identifying relevant AAOIFI standards that must be considered during detailed design
3. Highlighting potential Shariah compliance concerns early in the design process
