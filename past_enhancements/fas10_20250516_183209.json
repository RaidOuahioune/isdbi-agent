    "proposed_text": "Okay, acting as the Standards Enhancement Proposer Agent for the AAOIFI standards system, I will propose specific enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 based on the reviewer's analysis concerning the application to intangible assets like AI software development.\n\n**Objective:** To propose specific text enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 that address the ambiguities identified when applying the standard to Istisna'a contracts for intangible assets, specifically regarding 'well-defined subject matter', 'determination of cost', and 'measurement of progress'.\n\n**Original Text (as provided by the reviewer):**\nDr. Abdul Sattar Abughoddah\n10.\n\n*Note: The provided \"Original Text\" is incomplete and does not represent the full standard. Therefore, specific line edits to existing paragraphs are not possible. The proposed enhancements will be presented as potential additions or clarifications that could be inserted into the relevant sections of FAS 10 dealing with the definition of the subject matter, cost accumulation, and revenue/progress recognition.*\n\n**Proposed Enhancements:**\n\nBased on the reviewer's analysis, the following enhancements are proposed to provide clarity for Istisna'a contracts involving intangible assets.\n\n**Enhancement 1: Clarifying \"Well-defined Subject Matter\" for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Rationale:** The current standard's description of a \"well-defined subject matter\" is primarily tailored for tangible assets with physical characteristics. This creates ambiguity when the subject matter is intangible, such as software or a digital platform. This enhancement provides specific guidance on the *type* and *level* of specifications required for intangible assets to meet this requirement.\n*   **Proposed Addition:** Add a new paragraph or clause within the section discussing the requirements for the subject matter of the Istisna'a contract (e.g., supplementing the description of 'well-defined').\n\n    **Proposed Text:**\n    \"When the subject matter of the Istisna'a contract is an intangible asset, such as software, digital content, or a platform, the requirement for the subject matter to be 'well-defined' shall be met by providing detailed specifications that clearly delineate its intended functionality, performance characteristics, technical architecture, user interface requirements, data processing requirements, security protocols, integration points, and acceptance criteria. These specifications should be sufficiently detailed and agreed upon by both parties at the contract's inception to enable the manufacturer (developer) to produce the asset and for the buyer to understand the deliverables and verify completion according to the agreed terms. While the development process for complex intangible assets may involve iterative refinement of *implementation details* or minor adjustments within the defined scope, the core functional and technical specifications agreed upon initially must be clearly documented and considered the basis for the 'well-defined' requirement throughout the contract term.\"\n\n**Enhancement 2: Clarifying Cost Determination and Classification for Intangible Asset Development**\n\n*   **Rationale:** The standard's guidance on cost accumulation is based on traditional manufacturing costs (materials, labor, overhead). Software development costs differ significantly. This enhancement clarifies how costs specific to developing intangible assets should be classified and accumulated within the framework of FAS 10.\n*   **Proposed Addition:** Add a new paragraph or clause within the section defining the 'Cost of the Contract' or detailing cost measurement.\n\n    **Proposed Text:**\n    \"Costs attributable to an Istisna'a contract for the development of intangible assets, such as software, shall be accumulated reliably in accordance with the principles outlined in this standard. These costs represent the direct and indirect expenditures incurred to bring the intangible asset to its intended state of functionality and readiness. Such costs may include, but are not limited to:\n    (a) Direct labour costs for personnel directly involved in design, development (coding), testing, quality assurance, and project management activities specifically for the contract.\n    (b) Costs of acquiring and licensing necessary software development tools, platforms, libraries, and components directly used or consumed for the specific project.\n    (c) Costs of computing resources (e.g., cloud computing time, server access, specialized processing units) directly consumed in development, testing, data processing, and training activities specific to the project.\n    (d) Costs of acquiring or preparing necessary data (e.g., for machine learning model training, content creation) directly required for the functionality or testing of the intangible asset.\n    (e) Allocated overheads directly related to the software development activity, such as costs of development infrastructure, technical support, and security protocols specific to the project, allocated on a rational and systematic basis.\n    Costs that are not directly attributable to the specific contract or are general administrative expenses not related to the development activity shall be excluded from the cost of the contract.\"\n\n**Enhancement 3: Guidance on Measuring Progress for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Rationale:** Measuring progress towards completion is crucial for revenue and expense recognition, particularly under the percentage-of-completion method. Traditional physical milestones are not applicable to intangible assets. This enhancement provides guidance on appropriate and reliable methods for measuring progress in the context of software or intangible asset development.\n*   **Proposed Addition:** Add a new paragraph or clause within the section on 'Recognition of Revenue and Expenses' or 'Measurement of Progress Towards Completion'.\n\n    **Proposed Text:**\n    \"For Istisna'a contracts involving the development of intangible assets where physical milestones are not applicable or reliably measurable, progress towards completion shall be measured using methods that reliably reflect the extent of contract work performed. Appropriate methods may include:\n    (a) The cost-to-cost method, provided that total estimated costs and costs incurred can be reliably measured and directly related to the achievement of the defined project scope and deliverables. Particular attention should be paid to the reliability of estimating future costs for complex, novel, or iterative intangible development projects.\n    (b) Achievement of defined functional or technical milestones specified in the contract, provided these milestones represent substantive progress towards the completion of the defined subject matter and their achievement can be objectively verified by both parties.\n    (c) Completion of specific phases of the development lifecycle (e.g., requirements analysis complete, architecture design approved, core functionality development complete, integration testing passed), provided these phases are clearly defined, verifiable, and agreed upon in the contract as indicators of progress.\n    The financial institution shall select the method that provides the most reliable measure of the proportion of contract work completed for the specific intangible asset being developed. The method chosen shall be applied consistently throughout the contract term, and the basis for measuring progress shall be disclosed in the financial statements.\"\n\nThese proposed enhancements aim to address the identified ambiguities by providing explicit guidance tailored to the nature of intangible assets and their development processes, thereby improving the clarity and applicability of AAOIFI FAS 10 in modern financial transactions.",
    "review": "Okay, acting as the AAOIFI Standards Reviewer Agent, I will analyze AAOIFI FAS 10 concerning the application to an Istisna'a contract for the development of an AI software platform, focusing on the concepts of 'well-defined subject matter' and 'determination of cost'.\n\n**Analysis of AAOIFI FAS 10 in the context of AI Software Development Istisna'a**\n\n**Note:** The provided text \"Dr. Abdul Sattar Abughoddah 10.\" is incomplete and does not represent the full standard. My analysis is based on the general principles and likely requirements of AAOIFI FAS 10 as it pertains to Istisna'a contracts, assuming it follows the standard structure addressing subject matter definition, cost recognition, and revenue recognition.\n\n**Scenario:** A financial institution structuring an Istisna'a contract for a large-scale AI software platform development.\n\n**Key Areas of Concern based on Scenario:**\n1.  Applying the concept of 'well-defined subject matter' to intangible software.\n2.  Applying the concept of 'determination of cost' to software development costs.\n\n**Detailed Findings and Potential Areas for Enhancement:**\n\n**1. Section/Clause related to 'Well-defined Subject Matter'**\n\n*   **Likely Standard Requirement:** While not a specific quote from the incomplete text, a fundamental requirement for a valid Shariah-compliant Istisna'a contract, and consequently for its accounting treatment under FAS 10, is that the subject matter (the asset being manufactured) must be clearly specified or 'well-defined'. This typically involves detailed descriptions of physical characteristics, dimensions, materials, functionality, etc., necessary for the manufacturer to produce the item and for the buyer to know what they are receiving.\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The standard's criteria for \"well-defined\" are primarily developed with tangible assets (buildings, machinery, ships, etc.) in mind. Applying these criteria directly to intangible software is challenging. Software specifications involve functionalities, performance metrics, algorithms, data requirements, user interfaces, integration points, security protocols, scalability, etc. These are fundamentally different types of specifications than those for physical goods.\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:**\n    *   **Nature of Specifications:** It's unclear if the level and *type* of detail required by FAS 10 for tangible goods are sufficient or appropriate for complex AI software. Defining an AI platform \"well\" requires specifying not just features but also performance under various conditions, data requirements for training, ethical considerations, and how it learns and evolves.\n    *   **Iterative Development:** Software development, especially for complex AI, often involves iterative processes (like Agile methodologies) where specifications may evolve based on testing, data availability, and emerging requirements. While initial specs exist, the \"well-defined\" nature might be interpreted differently throughout the project lifecycle compared to a fixed physical blueprint.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Defining clear, objective acceptance criteria for software performance and functionality can be more complex than for physical goods, potentially leading to disputes or ambiguities that a standard focused on physical assets may not adequately address.\n    *   **Scope Creep:** The flexibility inherent in software development can lead to scope changes. The standard's framework for handling variations or amendments, designed for physical manufacturing, might not seamlessly apply to frequent software requirement adjustments.\n\n**2. Section/Clause related to 'Determination of Cost'**\n\n*   **Likely Standard Requirement:** FAS 10 would require the financial institution (as the manufacturer/developer in the Istisna'a contract) to accumulate and track costs reliably to determine the cost of the asset being developed and, if using the percentage-of-completion method, to measure progress towards completion. The standard would typically outline which costs are includable (direct materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead) and how they should be measured.\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The *nature* of costs incurred in software development differs significantly from traditional manufacturing costs for tangible goods.\n    *   **Absence of Physical Materials:** The major cost category of \"direct materials\" is largely absent or transformed in software development. While there might be costs for acquiring data or licensing components, they don't fit the traditional mold of raw materials.\n    *   **Nature of Overhead:** \"Manufacturing overhead\" needs redefinition. It would include costs like software licenses for development tools, cloud computing resources, testing infrastructure, data processing costs, and potentially specialized AI hardware access. The standard's guidance on allocating physical factory overhead might not be directly applicable.\n    *   **Measurement of Progress:** Measuring the \"percentage of completion\" often relies on cost incurred relative to total estimated costs, or physical milestones. For software, defining clear, verifiable physical milestones is difficult. Cost incurred might be easier to track, but reliability depends on accurate cost estimation for intangible work, which can be volatile. Functional milestones or lines of code are alternative metrics, but might not align with the standard's cost-centric approach to progress measurement.\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:**\n    *   **Cost Classification:** Difficulty in classifying specific software development costs (e.g., data acquisition for AI training, cloud compute time for model training, specialized AI libraries licensing) within the standard's traditional cost categories.\n    *   **Reliable Cost Estimation:** Estimating the total cost of complex, novel AI software development is inherently more uncertain than estimating the cost of manufacturing a well-understood physical item. This impacts the reliability of cost-based revenue recognition methods.\n    *   **Progress Measurement Challenges:** Applying cost-based percentage-of-completion methods is difficult when the relationship between costs incurred and physical progress is unclear or non-linear in software development. Other progress metrics (like functional completion or testing phase completion) might be more relevant but not explicitly covered or linked to revenue recognition in the standard.\n\n**Summary for Enhancement:**\n\nFAS 10, designed primarily for tangible manufactured goods, lacks explicit guidance on how to interpret \"well-defined subject matter\" and \"determination of cost\" when the subject matter is a complex intangible asset like AI software. Enhancement is needed to:\n\n1.  Provide specific guidance on the *type* and *level* of specifications required for intangible assets like software to be considered \"well-defined\" under the Istisna'a framework.\n2.  Clarify the nature and classification of costs specific to software development within the standard's cost accumulation requirements.\n3.  Offer guidance on appropriate methods for measuring progress towards completion for intangible assets, potentially including metrics beyond traditional cost-based approaches, or clarifying how cost-based methods can be reliably applied.\n\nThese enhancements would provide much-needed clarity for financial institutions structuring Istisna'a contracts for modern technological developments involving intangible assets.",

My analysis is based on the general principles and likely requirements of AAOIFI FAS 10 as it pertains to Istisna\\'a contracts, assuming it follows the standard structure addressing subject matter definition, cost recognition, and revenue recognition.\\n\\n**Scenario:** A financial institution structuring an Istisna\\'a contract for a large-scale AI software platform development.\\n\\n**Key Areas of Concern based on Scenario:**\\n1.  Applying the concept of \\'well-defined subject matter\\' to intangible software.\\n2.  Applying the concept of \\'determination of cost\\' to software development costs.\\n\\n**Detailed Findings and Potential Areas for Enhancement:**\\n\\n**1. Section/Clause related to \\'Well-defined Subject Matter\\'**\\n\\n*   **Likely Standard Requirement:** While not a specific quote from the incomplete text, a fundamental requirement for a valid Shariah-compliant Istisna\\'a contract, and consequently for its accounting treatment under FAS 10, is that the subject matter (the asset being manufactured) must be clearly specified or \\'well-defined\\'. This typically involves detailed descriptions of physical characteristics, dimensions, materials, functionality, etc., necessary for the manufacturer to produce the item and for the buyer to know what they are receiving.\\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The standard\\'s criteria for \"well-defined\" are primarily developed with tangible assets (buildings, machinery, ships, etc.) in mind. Applying these criteria directly to intangible software is challenging. Software specifications involve functionalities, performance metrics, algorithms, data requirements, user interfaces, integration points, security protocols, scalability, etc. These are fundamentally different types of specifications than those for physical goods.\\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:**\\n    *   **Nature of Specifications:** It\\'s unclear if the level and *type* of detail required by FAS 10 for tangible goods are sufficient or appropriate for complex AI software. Defining an AI platform \"well\" requires specifying not just features but also performance under various conditions, data requirements for training, ethical considerations, and how it learns and evolves.\\n    *   **Iterative Development:** Software development, especially for complex AI, often involves iterative processes (like Agile methodologies) where specifications may evolve based on testing, data availability, and emerging requirements. While initial specs exist, the \"well-defined\" nature might be interpreted differently throughout the project lifecycle compared to a fixed physical blueprint.\\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Defining clear, objective acceptance criteria for software performance and functionality can be more complex than for physical goods, potentially leading to disputes or ambiguities that a standard focused on physical assets may not adequately address.\\n    *   **Scope Creep:** The flexibility inherent in software development can lead to scope changes. The standard\\'s framework for handling variations or amendments, designed for physical manufacturing, might not seamlessly apply to frequent software requirement adjustments.\\n\\n**2. Section/Clause related to \\'Determination of Cost\\'**\\n\\n*   **Likely Standard Requirement:** FAS 10 would require the financial institution (as the manufacturer/developer in the Istisna\\'a contract) to accumulate and track costs reliably to determine the cost of the asset being developed and, if using the percentage-of-completion method, to measure progress towards completion. The standard would typically outline which costs are includable (direct materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead) and how they should be measured.\\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The *nature* of costs incurred in software development differs significantly from traditional manufacturing costs for tangible goods.\\n    *   **Absence of Physical Materials:** The major cost category of \"direct materials\" is largely absent or transformed in software development. While there might be costs for acquiring data or licensing components, they don\\'t fit the traditional mold of raw materials.\\n    *   **Nature of Overhead:** \"Manufacturing overhead\" needs redefinition. It would include costs like software licenses for development tools, cloud computing resources, testing infrastructure, data processing costs, and potentially specialized AI hardware access. The standard\\'s guidance on allocating physical factory overhead might not be directly applicable.\\n    *   **Measurement of Progress:** Measuring the \"percentage of completion\" often relies on cost incurred relative to total estimated costs, or physical milestones. For software, defining clear, verifiable physical milestones is difficult. Cost incurred might be easier to track, but reliability depends on accurate cost estimation for intangible work, which can be volatile. Functional milestones or lines of code are alternative metrics, but might not align with the standard\\'s cost-centric approach to progress measurement.\\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:**\\n    *   **Cost Classification:** Difficulty in classifying specific software development costs (e.g., data acquisition for AI training, cloud compute time for model training, specialized AI libraries licensing) within the standard\\'s traditional cost categories.\\n    *   **Reliable Cost Estimation:** Estimating the total cost of complex, novel AI software development is inherently more uncertain than estimating the cost of manufacturing a well-understood physical item. This impacts the reliability of cost-based revenue recognition methods.\\n    *   **Progress Measurement Challenges:** Applying cost-based percentage-of-completion methods is difficult when the relationship between costs incurred and physical progress is unclear or non-linear in software development.

Defining \"well-defined subject matter\" specifically for intangibles (functionality, performance, architecture, etc.).\\n2.  Clarifying cost determination and classification for intangible asset development (direct labor, software tools, computing resources, data, allocated overhead).\\n3.  Providing guidance on measuring progress for intangibles (cost-to-cost, functional/technical milestones, phase completion).\\n\\n**Validation Checks:**\\n\\n1.  **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\\n    *   **Core Principles:**\\n        *   *Riba, Maysir, Ethical Investment:* The proposed enhancement deals with the definition of the subject matter, cost accounting, and progress measurement within an Istisna\\'a framework. It does not introduce elements of interest, gambling, or prohibited industries. **Compliant.**\\n        *   *Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty):* A fundamental requirement for a valid Istisna\\'a contract is that the subject matter must be clearly specified to remove uncertainty (Para 4/1/1 of FAS 10, referencing Shariah requirements). The proposed enhancement directly addresses the challenge of applying this principle to intangible assets. By providing detailed examples of the *types* of specifications required for software (functionality, performance, architecture, etc.), Enhancement 1 actively *reduces* the potential for Gharar regarding the subject matter. The clarification on cost and progress measurement also reduces accounting uncertainty, supporting transparency which aligns with Shariah principles. **Enhances compliance by reducing Gharar related to intangible subject matter and accounting clarity.**\\n        *   *Asset-Backing:* Istisna\\'a requires the contract to be for the manufacture or acquisition of a specified asset. The proposal deals with *how* to define and account for an intangible asset (software) as the subject matter, not whether it qualifies as an asset. Intangible assets are recognized in modern accounting and can be the subject of Shariah-compliant contracts like Istisna\\'a if properly defined. FAS 4 (Musharaka) already acknowledges intangible assets as capital contributions, indicating acceptance within the AAOIFI framework. **Compliant.**\\n        *   *Risk-Sharing:* Istisna\\'a is a manufacturing contract where the Sani\\' (manufacturer/developer) bears the risk of production costs and performance according to specifications. The accounting methods (cost accumulation, progress measurement) described in the proposal are mechanisms for the Sani\\' to track performance and estimate profitability/losses against the fixed contract price, which is consistent with bearing this risk. **Compliant.**\\n    *   **FAS 10 Specific Principles:**\\n        *   *Specification of Subject Matter:* Enhancement 1 directly supports and operationalizes this principle (Para 4/1/1) for intangible assets, which is highly relevant given the nature of the trigger scenario (AI software). **Compliant and enhancing.**\\n        *   *Fixed Price:* The proposal does not alter the requirement for a fixed price in the Istisna\\'a contract. Cost determination and progress measurement are internal accounting matters for the Sani\\' within the fixed price framework. **Compliant.**\\n        *   *Delivery Terms, Parallel Independence, Liability and Risk:* The proposal does not contradict or alter these principles. **Compliant.**\\n\\n2.  **Consistency Check:**\\n    *   **Internal Consistency (FAS 10):**\\n        *   Enhancement 1 (Subject Matter Definition): Aligns with the existing requirement in Para 4/1/1 but provides necessary detail for a new asset class. It clarifies how \"kind, type, quality, and quantity\" might be interpreted for software.\\n        *   Enhancement 2 (Cost Determination): Consistent with Para 2/1 on including direct and allocated indirect costs and excluding G&A/R&D. It provides modern examples relevant to software development within these categories.\\n        *   Enhancement 3 (Progress Measurement): Consistent with the allowance for the Percentage-of-Completion method (Appendix E, Para 11) and the need for reliable estimation. It suggests methods (cost-to-cost, milestones, phases) that can serve as bases for measuring progress, acknowledging the need for reliability, especially for cost estimation in complex projects.\\n    *   **Consistency with Other Related Standards:**\\n        *   FAS 4 (Musharaka) explicitly mentions intangible assets in the context of capital contributions, indicating that AAOIFI standards acknowledge and provide guidance for intangible assets. This proposal is consistent with that broader recognition.\\n        *   FAS 7 (Salam) acknowledges non-cash forms of capital. While not directly related to the *subject matter* of Istisna\\'a, it shows AAOIFI standards are adaptable to non-traditional asset forms.\\n    *   The proposal seems consistent with the principles and existing framework of FAS 10 and related standards, adapting them rather than contradicting them. **Consistent.**\\n\\n3.  **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\\n    *   **Enhancement 1 (Subject Matter):** Requiring detailed specifications for software functionality, architecture, performance, etc., is standard practice in professional software development contracts (often documented in Statements of Work, Functional Specifications, Technical Specifications, etc.). This is highly practical and reflects industry norms. The allowance for iterative refinement of *implementation details* within the defined scope is also practical for modern development methodologies like Agile, provided the core specifications remain the basis.\\n    *   **Enhancement 2 (Cost Determination):** The listed cost categories (direct labor, software tools/licenses, computing resources, data, allocated overhead) are typical cost components tracked in software development projects. Accounting systems used by financial institutions and software development firms are capable of capturing and classifying these costs. This is practical.\\n    *   **Enhancement 3 (Progress Measurement):**\\n        *   Cost-to-cost is a standard method in construction/manufacturing, and applying it to software costs is feasible *if* reliable total cost estimates are available. The proposal correctly highlights the challenge of reliable estimation for complex/novel software.\\n        *   Using functional or technical milestones and completion of development phases as indicators of progress are common and practical methods in software development project management. Linking these verifiable milestones to revenue recognition is a recognized approach, potentially supporting or complementing a cost-based method.\\n    *   The proposal provides practical, implementable guidance tailored to the reality of modern software development, addressing areas where the traditional focus on tangible assets in FAS 10 creates practical difficulties. **Practical and Implementable.**\\n\\n4.  **Final Decision:**\\n\\nBased on the validation checks, the proposed enhancement:\\n*   Complies with core Shariah principles, particularly by reducing Gharar.\\n*   Is consistent with the existing framework and principles of AAOIFI FAS 10 and related standards.\\n*   Provides practical and implementable guidance relevant to modern transactions involving intangible assets.\\n\\nThe proposed text directly addresses the ambiguities identified in the trigger scenario and analysis, providing much-needed clarity for applying FAS 10 to a significant and growing area of economic activity.\\n\\n**Decision:** APPROVED.\\n\\n**Reasoning:** The proposed enhancements are a necessary and well-reasoned update to AAOIFI FAS 10 to ensure its continued relevance and applicability in the context of intangible assets like software. They operationalize existing Shariah and accounting principles for this new asset class, providing practical guidance on defining the subject matter, accounting for costs, and measuring progress. The proposal effectively reduces uncertainty (Gharar) in the application of the standard and is consistent with the broader AAOIFI framework.'}",

Therefore, specific line edits to existing paragraphs are not possible. The proposed enhancements will be presented as potential additions or clarifications that could be inserted into the relevant sections of FAS 10 dealing with the definition of the subject matter, cost accumulation, and revenue/progress recognition.*\n+ \n+ **Proposed Enhancements:**\n+ \n+ Based on the reviewer's analysis, the following enhancements are proposed to provide clarity for Istisna'a contracts involving intangible assets.\n+ \n+ **Enhancement 1: Clarifying \"Well-defined Subject Matter\" for Intangible Assets**\n+ \n+ *   **Rationale:** The current standard's description of a \"well-defined subject matter\" is primarily tailored for tangible assets with physical characteristics. This creates ambiguity when the subject matter is intangible, such as software or a digital platform. This enhancement provides specific guidance on the *type* and *level* of specifications required for intangible assets to meet this requirement.\n+ *   **Proposed Addition:** Add a new paragraph or clause within the section discussing the requirements for the subject matter of the Istisna'a contract (e.g., supplementing the description of 'well-defined').\n+ \n+     **Proposed Text:**\n+     \"When the subject matter of the Istisna'a contract is an intangible asset, such as software, digital content, or a platform, the requirement for the subject matter to be 'well-defined' shall be met by providing detailed specifications that clearly delineate its intended functionality, performance characteristics, technical architecture, user interface requirements, data processing requirements, security protocols, integration points, and acceptance criteria. These specifications should be sufficiently detailed and agreed upon by both parties at the contract's inception to enable the manufacturer (developer) to produce the asset and for the buyer to understand the deliverables and verify completion according to the agreed terms. While the development process for complex intangible assets may involve iterative refinement of *implementation details* or minor adjustments within the defined scope, the core functional and technical specifications agreed upon initially must be clearly documented and considered the basis for the 'well-defined' requirement throughout the contract term.\"\n+ \n+ **Enhancement 2: Clarifying Cost Determination and Classification for Intangible Asset Development**\n+ \n+ *   **Rationale:** The standard's guidance on cost accumulation is based on traditional manufacturing costs (materials, labor, overhead). Software development costs differ significantly. This enhancement clarifies how costs specific to developing intangible assets should be classified and accumulated within the framework of FAS 10.\n+ *   **Proposed Addition:** Add a new paragraph or clause within the section defining the 'Cost of the Contract' or detailing cost measurement.\n+ \n+     **Proposed Text:**\n+     \"Costs attributable to an Istisna'a contract for the development of intangible assets, such as software, shall be accumulated reliably in accordance with the principles outlined in this standard. These costs represent the direct and indirect expenditures incurred to bring the intangible asset to its intended state of functionality and readiness. Such costs may include, but are not limited to:\n+     (a) Direct labour costs for personnel directly involved in design, development (coding), testing, quality assurance, and project management activities specifically for the contract.\n+     (b) Costs of acquiring and licensing necessary software development tools, platforms, libraries, and components directly used or consumed for the specific project.\n+     (c) Costs of computing resources (e.g., cloud computing time, server access, specialized processing units) directly consumed in development, testing, data processing, and training activities specific to the project.\n+     (d) Costs of acquiring or preparing necessary data (e.g., for machine learning model training, content creation) directly required for the functionality or testing of the intangible asset.\n+     (e) Allocated overheads directly related to the software development activity, such as costs of development infrastructure, technical support, and security protocols specific to the project, allocated on a rational and systematic basis.\n+     Costs that are not directly attributable to the specific contract or are general administrative expenses not related to the development activity shall be excluded from the cost of the contract.\"\n+ \n+ **Enhancement 3: Guidance on Measuring Progress for Intangible Assets**\n+ \n+ *   **Rationale:** Measuring progress towards completion is crucial for revenue and expense recognition, particularly under the percentage-of-completion method. Traditional physical milestones are not applicable to intangible assets. This enhancement provides guidance on appropriate and reliable methods for measuring progress in the context of software or intangible asset development.\n+ *   **Proposed Addition:** Add a new paragraph or clause within the section on 'Recognition of Revenue and Expenses' or 'Measurement of Progress Towards Completion'.\n+ \n+     **Proposed Text:**\n+     \"For Istisna'a contracts involving the development of intangible assets where physical milestones are not applicable or reliably measurable, progress towards completion shall be measured using methods that reliably reflect the extent of contract work performed. Appropriate methods may include:\n+     (a) The cost-to-cost method, provided that total estimated costs and costs incurred can be reliably measured and directly related to the achievement of the defined project scope and deliverables. Particular attention should be paid to the reliability of estimating future costs for complex, novel, or iterative intangible development projects.\n+     (b) Achievement of defined functional or technical milestones specified in the contract, provided these milestones represent substantive progress towards the completion of the defined subject matter and their achievement can be objectively verified by both parties.\n+     (c) Completion of specific phases of the development lifecycle (e.g., requirements analysis complete, architecture design approved, core functionality development complete, integration testing passed), provided these phases are clearly defined, verifiable, and agreed upon in the contract as indicators of progress.\n+     The financial institution shall select the method that provides the most reliable measure of the proportion of contract work completed for the specific intangible asset being developed.

or detailing cost measurement.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Proposed Text:**\n    &quot;Costs attributable to an Istisna&#x27;a contract for the development of intangible assets, such as software, shall be accumulated reliably in accordance with the principles outlined in this standard.</span> <span class=\"addition\">These costs represent the direct and indirect expenditures incurred to bring the intangible asset to its intended state of functionality and readiness.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Such costs may include, but are not limited to:\n    (a) Direct labour costs for personnel directly involved in design, development (coding), testing, quality assurance, and project management activities specifically for the contract.</span> <span class=\"addition\">(b) Costs of acquiring and licensing necessary software development tools, platforms, libraries, and components directly used or consumed for the specific project.</span> <span class=\"addition\">(c) Costs of computing resources (e.g., cloud computing time, server access, specialized processing units) directly consumed in development, testing, data processing, and training activities specific to the project.</span> <span class=\"addition\">(d) Costs of acquiring or preparing necessary data (e.g., for machine learning model training, content creation) directly required for the functionality or testing of the intangible asset.</span> <span class=\"addition\">(e) Allocated overheads directly related to the software development activity, such as costs of development infrastructure, technical support, and security protocols specific to the project, allocated on a rational and systematic basis.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Costs that are not directly attributable to the specific contract or are general administrative expenses not related to the development activity shall be excluded from the cost of the contract.&quot;\n\n**Enhancement 3: Guidance on Measuring Progress for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Rationale:** Measuring progress towards completion is crucial for revenue and expense recognition, particularly under the percentage-of-completion method.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Traditional physical milestones are not applicable to intangible assets.</span> <span class=\"addition\">This enhancement provides guidance on appropriate and reliable methods for measuring progress in the context of software or intangible asset development.</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   **Proposed Addition:** Add a new paragraph or clause within the section on &#x27;Recognition of Revenue and Expenses&#x27; or &#x27;Measurement of Progress Towards Completion&#x27;.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Proposed Text:**\n    &quot;For Istisna&#x27;a contracts involving the development of intangible assets where physical milestones are not applicable or reliably measurable, progress towards completion shall be measured using methods that reliably reflect the extent of contract work performed.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Appropriate methods may include:\n    (a) The cost-to-cost method, provided that total estimated costs and costs incurred can be reliably measured and directly related to the achievement of the defined project scope and deliverables.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Particular attention should be paid to the reliability of estimating future costs for complex, novel, or iterative intangible development projects.</span> <span class=\"addition\">(b) Achievement of defined functional or technical milestones specified in the contract, provided these milestones represent substantive progress towards the completion of the defined subject matter and their achievement can be objectively verified by both parties.</span> <span class=\"addition\">(c) Completion of specific phases of the development lifecycle (e.g., requirements analysis complete, architecture design approved, core functionality development complete, integration testing passed), provided these phases are clearly defined, verifiable, and agreed upon in the contract as indicators of progress.</span> <span class=\"addition\">The financial institution shall select the method that provides the most reliable measure of the proportion of contract work completed for the specific intangible asset being developed.</span> <span class=\"addition\">The method chosen shall be applied consistently throughout the contract term, and the basis for measuring progress shall be disclosed in the financial statements.&quot;\n\nThese proposed enhancements aim to address the identified ambiguities by providing explicit guidance tailored to the nature of intangible assets and their development processes, thereby improving the clarity and applicability of AAOIFI FAS 10 in modern financial transactions.</span> ",
