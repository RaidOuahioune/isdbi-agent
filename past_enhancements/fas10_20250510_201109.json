    "review": "Okay, reviewing AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 10 on Istisna'a and Parallel Istisna'a in the context of developing a large-scale AI software platform highlights several areas where the standard, primarily drafted with tangible manufacturing or construction in mind, might require enhancement to adequately address intangible assets like software.\n\nHere are the detailed findings based on the provided text and the trigger scenario:\n\n1.  **Analysis of Section 4/1/1 - Al-Masnoo' (Subject Matter) Specifications**\n    *   **Specific Clause:** \"4/1/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019 must be known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its: a) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.; b) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.; c) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications; and d) Quantity.\" (Page 390)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The requirement to specify Al-Masnoo' by \"Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity,\" with examples focused on physical goods (car, airplane, house), presents ambiguity when applied to complex, large-scale intangible assets like AI software. While software has \"Kind\" (e.g., AI platform), \"Type\" (e.g., natural language processing AI), and arguably \"Quality\" (performance metrics, features), defining \"Quantity\" is not straightforward. More significantly, specifying *all* aspects (\"removing any lack of knowledge\") of a novel, large-scale AI platform upfront, according to \"established tables of specifications,\" is often impractical or impossible due to the inherent nature of software development, which involves iterative design, feature evolution, and performance tuning based on testing and data.\n    *   **Why this is an issue in the trigger scenario:** Developing a large-scale AI software platform is an inherently complex and often iterative process. The final \"product\" (Al-Masnoo') might evolve as development progresses, new data emerges, or technological breakthroughs occur. Requiring the same level of precise, upfront specification as a physical object like a car or house can be a barrier or lead to unrealistic contractual obligations for software. The standard doesn't provide specific guidance on how to define and specify intangible subject matter to meet the Shari'a requirement of avoiding *gharar* (uncertainty) in a way that aligns with modern software development methodologies.\n    *   **Sections needing enhancement:** Section 4/1/1 needs expansion or clarification to provide specific guidelines on defining and specifying intangible Al-Masnoo', including how Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity should be interpreted for software, and how to handle the iterative nature of development while maintaining Shari'a compliance regarding *gharar*.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Section 2/1(a) - Istisna'a Costs (Exclusion of R&D)**\n    *   **Specific Clause:** \"Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, **research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs.**\" (Page 368)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The explicit exclusion of \"research and development costs\" is a significant gap when the subject matter is a large-scale AI software platform. Software development, especially for cutting-edge AI, is fundamentally a form of research and development. The majority of the costs associated with building an AI platform (developer salaries, data acquisition and processing, training computational resources, algorithm design, testing) would likely fall under a broad interpretation of R&D or development costs.\n    *   **Why this is an issue in the trigger scenario:** If R&D/development costs are excluded from Istisna'a contract costs, the accounting under FAS 10 would not reflect the true economic cost of developing the AI software. This would lead to an understatement of the asset (Istisna'a work-in-progress) and a misrepresentation of the project's profitability or loss. The core \"production\" cost of software *is* the development cost, which the standard currently prohibits from inclusion. This seems to stem from a traditional view of manufacturing costs (raw materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead) that doesn't translate well to knowledge work like software engineering.\n    *   **Sections needing enhancement:** Section 2/1(a) needs a fundamental re-evaluation or clarification regarding the treatment of development costs for intangible assets like software. It should provide guidance on which specific costs related to software engineering, data science, algorithm development, testing, etc., *can* and *should* be capitalized as Istisna'a costs when the subject matter is software, effectively distinguishing these from general, non-contract-specific R&D.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Sections 2/1(b), 2/2(a), 2/4(a), Appendix F - Cost and Work-in-Progress Accounts & Measurement**\n    *   **Specific Clauses:**\n        *   2/1(b): \"Istisna\u2019a costs incurred... shall be recognized in an Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress account...\" (Page 368)\n        *   2/2(a): In parallel Istisna'a, \"costs... will be debited to Istisna\u2019a costs account...\" (Page 369)\n        *   2/4(a): \"Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress shall be measured and reported... at a value not exceeding its cash equivalent value (i.e., the difference between the contract price and the expected additional cost to complete the contract).\" (Page 372)\n        *   Appendix F Definitions: Defines \"Istisna'a Work-in-Progress Account\" and \"Istisna'a Costs Account\" as accounts where \"Istisna'a contract costs are accumulated.\" (Page 402)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The terminology (\"work-in-progress,\" \"costs account\") and the measurement basis (\"expected additional cost to complete\") are clearly rooted in tangible construction/manufacturing. While these concepts can be *adapted* to software, the standard doesn't provide specific guidance on *how*. Accumulating \"costs\" for software involves tracking personnel time, computing resources, software licenses, data acquisition, etc., which differs significantly from tracking raw materials or factory labor. Estimating the \"expected additional cost to complete\" a large, complex AI software project is often highly uncertain, especially in the early or mid-stages, due to evolving requirements, unforeseen technical challenges, or performance targets that require extensive iteration.\n    *   **Why this is an issue in the trigger scenario:** The lack of specific guidance makes applying the accounting methods (Percentage-of-Completion, which relies heavily on cost estimation - Appendix E, Page 400) difficult and subjective for AI software. How do you reliably estimate the cost to complete an AI model's training or optimize its performance? This uncertainty makes the preferred Percentage-of-Completion method less applicable and potentially forces the use of the less informative Completed-Contract method (2/3/1/2), which delays revenue/profit recognition until completion, not reflecting the economic activity during the development period. The terminology itself could be refined or supplemented to better fit intangible development.\n    *   **Sections needing enhancement:** Sections 2/1(b), 2/2(a), 2/4(a), and Appendix F definitions need supplementary guidance on how to interpret and apply the concepts of \"costs,\" \"work-in-progress,\" and \"cost to complete\" in the context of intangible asset development like software. This includes detailing the types of costs that should be accumulated and providing acceptable methods for estimating the percentage of completion and cost to complete for software projects, acknowledging the inherent uncertainties.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Appendix (C) Juristic Rules - Footnote 7**\n    *   **Specific Clause:** Footnote (7) on page 389 states: \"The subject matter may be a commodity, service or both.\"\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** While this footnote acknowledges the possibility of Istisna'a applying to services or a combination, the main body of the standard and its examples are heavily focused on physical commodities (\"manufacturing,\" \"car, airoplane or house\"). The detailed rules (like specification requirements in 4/1/1, cost definitions in 2/1) don't elaborate on how to apply these rules when the subject matter is primarily a service or an intangible asset like software.\n    *   **Why this is an issue in the trigger scenario:** This creates a disconnect. The footnote suggests Istisna'a *can* be used for services/intangibles, which fits the AI software scenario. However, the operational accounting and Shari'a validation rules within the standard seem predominantly designed for tangibles, leading to the ambiguities and gaps noted above regarding specification and cost. The standard doesn't provide the necessary framework to *operationalize* the application of Istisna'a to non-tangible subject matter effectively and without ambiguity.\n    *   **Sections needing enhancement:** The main body of the standard and its appendices need to be updated to fully integrate the concept that Al-Masnoo' can be a service or intangible asset. This involves revising or adding specific guidance within the relevant sections (specifications, costs, measurement, revenue recognition, examples) to address the unique characteristics of intangible development projects.\n\nIn summary, while FAS 10 provides a foundational framework for Istisna'a, its current wording and examples are heavily biased towards tangible assets. Applying it directly to the development of a complex, large-scale AI software platform reveals significant ambiguities and gaps, particularly concerning the precise definition and specification of the subject matter and the identification, accumulation, and measurement of development costs which are core to such projects. Enhancement is needed to provide clear, applicable guidance for intangible assets.",
    "proposal": "```\n# Proposal 1: Clarifying Specification Requirements for Intangible Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe current requirements for specifying Al-Masnoo' (subject matter) in Section 4/1/1 are framed using examples of tangible assets (cars, houses) and require specification to the extent of \"removing any lack of knowledge\" regarding Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity. This level of upfront, precise specification is often impractical or impossible for complex, novel intangible assets like large-scale software, especially AI platforms, which involve iterative development and evolving requirements, creating ambiguity and potential barriers to applying Istisna'a to such projects.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\n4. Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a\n(11)\nFor the validity of Istisna\u2019a, the following rules should be fulfilled:\n4/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019\n4/1/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019 must be known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its:\na) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.;\nb) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.;\nc) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications; and\nd) Quantity.\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n4. Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a\n(11)\nFor the validity of Istisna\u2019a, the following rules should be fulfilled:\n4/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019\n4/1/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019 must be known and specified to the extent of removing any significant lack of knowledge (gharar) of its essential characteristics. For tangible assets, this typically includes:\na) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.;\nb) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.;\nc) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications; and\nd) Quantity.\nWhen Al-Masnoo\u2019 is an intangible asset or service, such as software, the specification requirements shall be applied considering the nature of the asset and the development process. Specification should focus on defining the core functionalities, performance criteria, key features, and scope of work sufficient to mitigate significant uncertainty (gharar) regarding the subject matter. While initial specifications should be detailed, the contract may incorporate mechanisms for refining certain aspects of Type, Quality, or scope during the development lifecycle, provided that the core agreement remains clear and any changes are managed through agreed-upon change order procedures. The concept of \"Quantity\" for intangible assets shall be interpreted in terms of defined deliverables, user capacity, processing capability, or other relevant metrics appropriate to the asset.\n\n## Rationale\nThis enhancement clarifies that while the principle of clear specification remains vital to avoid *gharar*, the *method* of specification should be adaptable to the nature of the asset. It explicitly includes intangible assets like software and provides guidance on how Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity might be interpreted in this context, focusing on functionalities, performance, and scope. It acknowledges the iterative nature of software development by allowing for specification refinement within a controlled change management framework, which is crucial for complex projects like AI platforms, without compromising the fundamental requirement to avoid significant uncertainty about the core subject matter. This makes the standard more applicable and practical for modern intangible asset development.\n\n```\n# Proposal 2: Clarifying Treatment of Development Costs for Intangible Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nSection 2/1(a) explicitly excludes \"research and development costs\" from Istisna'a contract costs. For the development of complex intangible assets like AI software, the primary costs are inherently related to development activities (software engineering, data science, algorithm training, etc.). Excluding these costs prevents the accurate reflection of the true cost of production for intangible Al-Masnoo', leading to an understatement of the Istisna'a asset and misrepresentation of project profitability.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\n2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)\n2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs\na) Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs. (para. 2)\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)\n2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs\na) Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs directly attributable to producing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, and research costs not specifically related to the Istisna\u2019a contract shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs. For intangible assets such as software, costs directly related to the design, development, coding, testing, and deployment activities necessary to produce Al-Masnoo\u2019 according to contract specifications shall be included as Istisna\u2019a contract costs. This includes costs such as personnel directly involved in development, computing resources used for development and testing, and direct software licenses required for the project. (para. 2)\n\n## Rationale\nThis enhancement distinguishes between general, non-contract-specific research costs and the specific development costs incurred to produce the contracted Al-Masnoo', particularly for intangible assets like software. It clarifies that costs directly attributable to the development lifecycle of the software (design, coding, testing, etc.) *are* considered Istisna'a costs. This aligns the accounting treatment with the economic reality of software development projects structured as Istisna'a, ensuring that the asset (work-in-progress) and project costs are properly measured and reported, thus providing more relevant financial information.\n\n```\n# Proposal 3: Adapting Cost Accumulation and Measurement Guidance for Intangible Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe terminology and examples used in sections dealing with cost accumulation (2/1(b), 2/2(a), Appendix F) and measurement (2/4(a)) are primarily geared towards tangible assets and construction (\"work-in-progress,\" \"cost to complete\"). While the concepts are adaptable, the standard lacks specific guidance on how to apply these to intangible assets like software. Estimating the \"cost to complete\" complex software projects can be highly uncertain, making the preferred Percentage-of-Completion method challenging to apply reliably.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\n2/1(b) Istisna\u2019a costs incurred during a financial period... shall be recognized in an Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress account... (In case of parallel Istisna\u2019a, this account shall be called Istisna\u2019a costs account...)... (para. 3)\n2/2(a) When a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists, the costs of Istisna\u2019a include the price fixed in the parallel Istisna\u2019a contract (direct costs)... these will be debited to Istisna\u2019a costs account... (para. 5)\n2/4(a) In the event of applying the percentage of completion method... Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress shall be measured and reported... at a value not exceeding its cash equivalent value (i.e., the difference between the contract price and the expected additional cost to complete the contract). (para. 19)\nAppendix (F) Definitions:\nIstisna\u2019a Work-in-Progress Account: This is an asset account in which the Istisna\u2019a contract costs are accumulated...\nIstisna\u2019a Costs Account: This is an asset account used when a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists. It accumulates progress billings made by the subcontractor...\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n2/1(b) Istisna\u2019a costs incurred during a financial period, as defined in 2/1(a), as well as pre-contract costs as described in (c) below, shall be recognized in an Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress account, and reported under assets in the statement of financial position of the Islamic bank. (In case of parallel Istisna\u2019a, this account shall be called Istisna\u2019a costs account as stated in 2/2 a). For intangible assets like software, the accumulation of costs in the work-in-progress account shall reflect the direct and indirect costs incurred in the development lifecycle. Amounts billed to Al-Mustasni\u2019 will be debited to Istisna\u2019a accounts receivable account and credited to an Istisna\u2019a billings account. (para. 3)\n2/2(a) When a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists, the costs of Istisna\u2019a include the price fixed in the parallel Istisna\u2019a contract (direct costs), together with indirect costs including any pre-contract costs as described in 2/1(c). For parallel Istisna\u2019a involving intangible assets like software development by a subcontractor, the costs accumulated shall include the amounts billed by the subcontractor for the agreed-upon development work. When the subcontractor bills the Islamic bank for contract costs, these will be debited to Istisna\u2019a costs account and credited to the subcontractor\u2019s Al-Sani\u2019 account under Istisna\u2019a accounts payable. The Istisna\u2019a costs account shall be reported under assets in the statement of financial position of the Islamic bank. (para. 5)\n2/4(a) In the event of applying the percentage of completion method for the recognition of Istisna\u2019a revenue and profit, Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress shall be measured and reported in the statement of financial position of the Islamic bank at a value not exceeding its cash equivalent value (i.e., the difference between the contract price and the expected additional cost to complete the contract). For intangible assets like software, estimating the percentage of completion and the expected additional cost to complete the contract requires reliable methods appropriate for development projects, such as milestones achieved, input measures (e.g., labor hours or costs incurred relative to total estimated costs), or output measures (e.g., completion of specific modules or features). The method used must be applied consistently and the basis for estimation disclosed. (para. 19)\nAppendix (F) Definitions:\nIstisna\u2019a Work-in-Progress Account: This is an asset account in which the Istisna\u2019a contract costs are accumulated. For intangible assets, these costs represent the cumulative investment in the development of Al-Masnoo\u2019 according to contract specifications. When the percentage-of-completion method is used, a portion of Istisna\u2019a profit commensurate with the work completed during a financial period is also debited to this account.\nIstisna\u2019a Costs Account: This is an asset account used when a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists. It accumulates progress billings made by the subcontractor for work on the Istisna\u2019a subject matter. For intangible assets, this account accumulates costs incurred by the subcontractor for the development of Al-Masnoo\u2019. A portion of the Istisna\u2019a profit commensurate with the work completed during a financial period is also debited to this account.\n\n## Rationale\nThese modifications explicitly incorporate intangible assets into the descriptions of cost accumulation and measurement. They clarify that \"work-in-progress\" and \"costs\" accounts for software accumulate development-related costs. Crucially, the enhancement to 2/4(a) provides examples of acceptable methods for estimating percentage of completion and cost to complete for software projects, acknowledging the need for methods suitable for development rather than just physical construction. This provides practical guidance for applying the standard's accounting methods to intangible assets and addresses the uncertainty issue highlighted by the reviewer.\n\n```\n# Proposal 4: Explicitly Integrating Intangible Assets into the Standard's Scope and Principles\n\n## Issue Identified\nWhile Footnote 7 mentions that Al-Masnoo' can be a service or both commodity and service, the main body and detailed rules of the standard are predominantly framed around tangible manufacturing/construction, creating a disconnect and leaving users uncertain about the full applicability and interpretation of the rules for intangible assets like software.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nAppendix (C)\nJuristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n2. Definition\nIstisna\u2019a is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller), whereby Al-Sani\u2019- based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured or otherwise acquired Al-Masnoo\u2019 (7) (the subject matter of the contract) according to the specifications and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be in advance, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time.\n(7) The subject matter may be a commodity, service or both.\n\nFinancial Accounting Standard No. (10): Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n368\nStatement of the Standard\n1. Scope of the Standard\nThis standard addresses the accounting rules of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a contracts in the financial statements of Islamic banks relating to measuring and recognizing the costs and revenues from Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a, the gains and losses accruing therefrom, and their presentation and disclosure in the financial statements of the Islamic bank.\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\nAppendix (C)\nJuristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n2. Definition\nIstisna\u2019a is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller), whereby Al-Sani\u2019- based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured, developed, constructed, or otherwise acquired Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract), which may be a tangible commodity, an intangible asset (such as software), a service, or a combination thereof, according to the specifications and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be in advance, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time. It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide either the raw material or the labour (or the intellectual property/development effort in the case of intangible assets).\n\nFinancial Accounting Standard No. (10): Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n368\nStatement of the Standard\n1. Scope of the Standard\nThis standard addresses the accounting rules of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a contracts in the financial statements of Islamic banks relating to measuring and recognizing the costs and revenues from Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a, the gains and losses accruing therefrom, and their presentation and disclosure in the financial statements of the Islamic bank. The standard applies to Istisna\u2019a contracts where the subject matter (Al-Masnoo\u2019) is a tangible commodity, an intangible asset (such as software), a service, or a combination thereof, that is manufactured, developed, or constructed according to specific requirements.\n\n## Rationale\nThis enhancement moves the acknowledgement of intangible assets and services from a footnote into the main text of the definition and the scope of the standard. By explicitly mentioning intangible assets like software and the processes of \"development\" alongside \"manufacturing\" and \"construction,\" it clearly establishes the standard's intended applicability to such projects from the outset. This provides a stronger foundation for interpreting the subsequent, more detailed rules in the context of intangible assets and reinforces the need for the specific guidance provided in the other proposals. It also slightly refines the condition regarding Al-Sani's contribution to better fit intangible development.\n```",
    "validation": "Okay, I will evaluate each proposed enhancement to AAOIFI FAS 10 based on the provided criteria.\n\n---\n\n**Validation of Proposed Enhancement to AAOIFI FAS 10**\n\n**Overall Context:** The proposed enhancements aim to clarify the application of FAS 10, which was primarily drafted with tangible manufacturing and construction in mind, to the development of complex intangible assets, specifically large-scale software like AI platforms. This is a relevant need in modern Islamic finance practice.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 1: Clarifying Specification Requirements for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Validation Check: Shariah Compliance**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The core Shariah principle addressed here is the prohibition of Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty). Original FAS 10 (4/1/1) requires specifying Al-Masnoo' \"to the extent of removing *any* lack of knowledge.\" This is a strict interpretation aimed at minimizing Gharar. Istisna'a's validity, particularly for items not yet in existence, is based on Istihsan (juristic preference) and Maslaha (public interest/need), recognizing that some inherent uncertainty might exist compared to a spot sale. The proposed change explicitly acknowledges that for complex, novel intangible assets like software, precise upfront specification to the extent of removing *any* lack of knowledge can be practically impossible due to the iterative nature of development. By changing \"any lack of knowledge\" to \"significant lack of knowledge (gharar) of its essential characteristics,\" the proposal aligns with the nuanced Shariah view that prohibits *excessive* or *significant* Gharar (`Gharar fahish`) while permitting minor or unavoidable Gharar (`Gharar yaseer`) for Maslaha, especially in contracts like Istisna'a which are deviations from strict Qiyas. Allowing mechanisms for refining non-essential aspects (Type, Quality, scope) through controlled change orders (already addressed in FAS 10, e.g., 2/5) further mitigates potential Gharar by providing a structured process for managing uncertainty during execution, provided the core subject matter remains clear. The adaptation of \"Quantity\" to relevant metrics for intangibles is a necessary and Shariah-compliant interpretation. The proposal appears to maintain the spirit of Gharar avoidance while making the standard applicable to modern asset types.\n*   **Validation Check: FAS 10 Consistency**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal directly modifies Section 4/1/1. It introduces necessary flexibility for intangible assets while retaining the core requirement for clear specification sufficient to avoid *significant* uncertainty. It explicitly links specification refinement to change order procedures, which are already part of FAS 10 (Section 2/5 addresses change orders and additional claims). This maintains internal consistency by leveraging existing standard mechanisms. The adaptation of terminology (Quantity for intangibles) is necessary for applicability.\n*   **Validation Check: Other Standards Alignment**\n    *   **Reasoning:** Other AAOIFI standards, like FAS 4 (Musharaka), acknowledge the existence and potential valuation of intangible assets (Appendix D mentions valuation of intangible assets in Musharaka capital). While those standards don't detail Istisna'a-specific requirements, this proposal's recognition of intangible assets as valid subject matter and the need for adapted specification methods is consistent with the broader AAOIFI framework's increasing need to address modern asset types. The core principle of clear subject matter is consistent with other deferred contracts like Salam (FAS 7), although the specific requirements differ due to the nature of the contracts.\n*   **Validation Check: Practical Implementation**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This proposal is highly practical and reflects the reality of complex software development projects. Requiring \"any lack of knowledge\" to be removed upfront for novel software is unrealistic. Allowing specification based on core functionalities and performance, with mechanisms for refinement through controlled change management, is standard industry practice. This makes Istisna'a a viable and practical contract for financing such projects.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED**\n    *   **Detailed Feedback:** The proposal provides a crucial and practical adaptation of the specification requirements for intangible assets. It appropriately interprets the Shariah principle of Gharar avoidance in the context of Istisna'a for complex, iterative development. It maintains consistency with the standard by leveraging existing change management mechanisms and makes the standard significantly more applicable to modern finance needs.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 2: Clarifying Treatment of Development Costs for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Validation Check: Shariah Compliance**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The original exclusion of \"research and development costs\" from Istisna'a costs (2/1(a)) is primarily an accounting principle rooted in conservatism and matching, not a direct Shariah prohibition. Shariah requires fairness and transparency in financial dealings. In the context of Istisna'a, the Sani' incurs costs to produce the asset, which form the basis for calculating the profit (fixed contract price minus total costs). Excluding costs directly attributable to the *production* (development) of the contracted software asset would misrepresent the true cost of the asset and the resulting profit, potentially hindering transparency. The proposed enhancement correctly distinguishes between general research costs (which should remain excluded) and specific development costs directly incurred to fulfill the Istisna'a contract specifications. Including these direct development costs aligns the accounting treatment with the economic reality of creating the asset, which is necessary for fair and accurate reporting. There is no Shariah principle violated by capitalizing costs directly related to producing the contracted asset.\n*   **Validation Check: FAS 10 Consistency**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal directly modifies Section 2/1(a). It provides a necessary clarification for applying the existing rule to intangible assets. It refines the definition of excluded costs to \"research costs not specifically related to the Istisna'a contract,\" logically implying that *development* costs *specifically related* to the contract are included. This clarification maintains the structure of the cost definition while making it applicable to the specific nature of intangible asset creation. It is consistent with the overall objective of recognizing the cost of Al-Masnoo'.\n*   **Validation Check: Other Standards Alignment**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This aligns with the general accounting principle of recognizing the costs incurred to create an asset. While not directly referenced in other Islamic finance standards regarding *Istisna'a* costs, it is consistent with the need for accurate cost measurement and asset valuation, which underpins financial reporting in all contexts.\n*   **Validation Check: Practical Implementation**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is highly practical. The primary costs in software development *are* development costs (personnel, computing, etc.). Excluding these would make accounting for software Istisna'a projects nonsensical and fail to reflect the investment made in creating the asset. Including these costs allows for accurate tracking of project costs and proper valuation of the work-in-progress.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED**\n    *   **Detailed Feedback:** The proposal provides essential clarification for cost accounting in intangible asset Istisna'a projects. It aligns the standard with economic reality and allows for proper measurement of the Istisna'a asset and profit, consistent with Shariah principles of transparency and fairness in reporting.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 3: Adapting Cost Accumulation and Measurement Guidance for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Validation Check: Shariah Compliance**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This proposal primarily addresses accounting measurement methods (Percentage of Completion - PoC). Accounting methods themselves are generally not direct Shariah matters, provided they don't involve prohibited elements like Riba or Maysir. The Shariah concern here relates to Gharar in financial reporting if profit recognition is based on unreliable estimates. The original FAS 10 Basis for Conclusions (Appendix E) highlights that a \"crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy.\" Estimating \"cost to complete\" for complex software projects can be challenging, potentially introducing Gharar into the profit recognition process if methods are not appropriate. The proposal mitigates this by providing examples of *reliable methods* suitable for software development (milestones, input/output measures). This increases the likelihood that the PoC estimates are reasonably accurate, thereby reducing potential Gharar in the reported financial position and performance.\n*   **Validation Check: FAS 10 Consistency**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal modifies Sections 2/1(b), 2/2(a), 2/4(a), and Appendix F definitions. It explicitly includes intangible assets in the descriptions of work-in-progress and costs accounts. Crucially, it enhances 2/4(a) by providing specific, relevant examples for estimating percentage of completion for software projects. This directly supports and makes applicable the preferred PoC method already stated in the standard (2/4(a), Appendix E Basis for Conclusions). It clarifies how the existing accounting framework applies to this asset type without changing the underlying principles or account structures.\n*   **Validation Check: Other Standards Alignment**\n    *   **Reasoning:** Consistent with the general requirement for financial statements to provide relevant and representationally faithful information, as outlined in AAOIFI's conceptual framework (Statement of Objectives and Concepts, referenced in Appendix E of FAS 10 and Appendix D of FAS 4). Provides practical guidance for applying measurement principles to intangible assets, consistent with the acknowledgement of such assets in other standards (like FAS 4).\n*   **Validation Check: Practical Implementation**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This proposal is essential for practical implementation. Without specific guidance, applying concepts like \"work-in-progress\" or estimating \"cost to complete\" (especially for PoC) to software is difficult and prone to inconsistency. The suggested methods (milestones, input/output measures) are standard project management and accounting techniques used in software development. Providing these examples makes the standard's accounting requirements implementable for this type of project.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED**\n    *   **Detailed Feedback:** This proposal provides vital practical guidance for applying the standard's cost accumulation and measurement rules to intangible assets. By suggesting appropriate methods for estimating percentage of completion, it enhances the reliability of financial reporting for software Istisna'a projects, consistent with the underlying Shariah principle of avoiding excessive Gharar in financial representation.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 4: Explicitly Integrating Intangible Assets into the Standard's Scope and Principles**\n\n*   **Validation Check: Shariah Compliance**\n    *   **Reasoning:** Explicitly stating that intangible assets like software are within the scope of Istisna'a and defining Al-Masnoo' to include them improves transparency and clarity regarding the standard's applicability. The refinement of Al-Sani's contribution to include \"intellectual property/development effort\" accurately reflects the nature of producing intangible assets, aligning the contract's conditions with the reality of the subject matter. This enhances clarity and avoids potential ambiguity regarding the underlying asset and process, which supports the Shariah principles of transparency and fairness. No Shariah principle is violated; rather, clarity is improved.\n*   **Validation Check: FAS 10 Consistency**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal moves information from a footnote (Appendix C, Footnote 7) into the main body of the definition and scope (Appendix C, Section 2 and Section 1). This is a logical and necessary structural change to provide a strong foundation for the more detailed rules (as addressed in the other proposals). It reinforces that the standard is *intended* to cover these assets, removing any doubt arising from the current peripheral mention. It is internally consistent and improves the standard's overall structure and clarity.\n*   **Validation Check: Other Standards Alignment**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This change aligns FAS 10 more explicitly with the reality that intangible assets are recognized and dealt with in Islamic finance, as implicitly or explicitly acknowledged in other AAOIFI standards (e.g., FAS 4 regarding intangible assets in Musharaka capital). It modernizes the standard's language to reflect contemporary asset types.\n*   **Validation Check: Practical Implementation**\n    *   **Reasoning:** Explicitly stating intangible assets in the scope and definition removes ambiguity for users of the standard. It clarifies from the outset that software development, for instance, can be structured as Istisna'a and is covered by this standard, guiding users to apply the subsequent rules appropriately. This makes the standard easier to navigate and apply to relevant transactions.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED**\n    *   **Detailed Feedback:** This proposal provides the necessary foundational clarity by explicitly integrating intangible assets into the core definition and scope of FAS 10. This supports the specific adaptations proposed in the other enhancements and makes the standard's applicability to modern asset types unambiguous, enhancing transparency and ease of use.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nAll four proposed enhancements are well-reasoned, interconnected, and address genuine challenges in applying AAOIFI FAS 10 to modern intangible asset development, specifically large-scale software projects. They collectively:\n\n1.  Adapt Shariah principles, particularly the avoidance of Gharar, in a practical and nuanced way suitable for the iterative nature of intangible development.\n2.  Provide essential clarification for cost recognition and measurement for intangible assets within the existing accounting framework of FAS 10.\n3.  Improve the standard's consistency, clarity, and practical applicability to modern Islamic finance transactions involving intangible assets.\n\nThe proposals are consistent with the underlying Shariah principles of Istisna'a (fixed price, specified subject matter, Sani' provides labor/effort) and the broader objectives of AAOIFI standards (transparency, fairness, reliable financial reporting). They do not introduce Riba, Maysir, or violate other core principles.\n\nTherefore, based on the validation criteria:\n\n**Overall Decision: APPROVED**\n\n**Detailed Reasoning:** The proposed enhancements collectively represent a necessary and appropriate update to AAOIFI FAS 10 to ensure its continued relevance and practicality in addressing modern financial transactions involving complex intangible assets. They address identified ambiguities, provide essential guidance, and maintain compliance with Shariah principles and the internal consistency of the standard.",

        "review_analysis": "Okay, reviewing AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 10 on Istisna'a and Parallel Istisna'a in the context of developing a large-scale AI software platform highlights several areas where the standard, primarily drafted with tangible manufacturing or construction in mind, might require enhancement to adequately address intangible assets like software.\n\nHere are the detailed findings based on the provided text and the trigger scenario:\n\n1.  **Analysis of Section 4/1/1 - Al-Masnoo' (Subject Matter) Specifications**\n    *   **Specific Clause:** \"4/1/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019 must be known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its: a) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.; b) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.; c) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications; and d) Quantity.\" (Page 390)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The requirement to specify Al-Masnoo' by \"Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity,\" with examples focused on physical goods (car, airplane, house), presents ambiguity when applied to complex, large-scale intangible assets like AI software. While software has \"Kind\" (e.g., AI platform), \"Type\" (e.g., natural language processing AI), and arguably \"Quality\" (performance metrics, features), defining \"Quantity\" is not straightforward. More significantly, specifying *all* aspects (\"removing any lack of knowledge\") of a novel, large-scale AI platform upfront, according to \"established tables of specifications,\" is often impractical or impossible due to the inherent nature of software development, which involves iterative design, feature evolution, and performance tuning based on testing and data.\n    *   **Why this is an issue in the trigger scenario:** Developing a large-scale AI software platform is an inherently complex and often iterative process. The final \"product\" (Al-Masnoo') might evolve as development progresses, new data emerges, or technological breakthroughs occur. Requiring the same level of precise, upfront specification as a physical object like a car or house can be a barrier or lead to unrealistic contractual obligations for software. The standard doesn't provide specific guidance on how to define and specify intangible subject matter to meet the Shari'a requirement of avoiding *gharar* (uncertainty) in a way that aligns with modern software development methodologies.\n    *   **Sections needing enhancement:** Section 4/1/1 needs expansion or clarification to provide specific guidelines on defining and specifying intangible Al-Masnoo', including how Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity should be interpreted for software, and how to handle the iterative nature of development while maintaining Shari'a compliance regarding *gharar*.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Section 2/1(a) - Istisna'a Costs (Exclusion of R&D)**\n    *   **Specific Clause:** \"Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, **research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs.**\" (Page 368)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The explicit exclusion of \"research and development costs\" is a significant gap when the subject matter is a large-scale AI software platform. Software development, especially for cutting-edge AI, is fundamentally a form of research and development. The majority of the costs associated with building an AI platform (developer salaries, data acquisition and processing, training computational resources, algorithm design, testing) would likely fall under a broad interpretation of R&D or development costs.\n    *   **Why this is an issue in the trigger scenario:** If R&D/development costs are excluded from Istisna'a contract costs, the accounting under FAS 10 would not reflect the true economic cost of developing the AI software. This would lead to an understatement of the asset (Istisna'a work-in-progress) and a misrepresentation of the project's profitability or loss. The core \"production\" cost of software *is* the development cost, which the standard currently prohibits from inclusion. This seems to stem from a traditional view of manufacturing costs (raw materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead) that doesn't translate well to knowledge work like software engineering.\n    *   **Sections needing enhancement:** Section 2/1(a) needs a fundamental re-evaluation or clarification regarding the treatment of development costs for intangible assets like software. It should provide guidance on which specific costs related to software engineering, data science, algorithm development, testing, etc., *can* and *should* be capitalized as Istisna'a costs when the subject matter is software, effectively distinguishing these from general, non-contract-specific R&D.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Sections 2/1(b), 2/2(a), 2/4(a), Appendix F - Cost and Work-in-Progress Accounts & Measurement**\n    *   **Specific Clauses:**\n        *   2/1(b): \"Istisna\u2019a costs incurred... shall be recognized in an Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress account...\" (Page 368)\n        *   2/2(a): In parallel Istisna'a, \"costs... will be debited to Istisna\u2019a costs account...\" (Page 369)\n        *   2/4(a): \"Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress shall be measured and reported... at a value not exceeding its cash equivalent value (i.e., the difference between the contract price and the expected additional cost to complete the contract).\" (Page 372)\n        *   Appendix F Definitions: Defines \"Istisna'a Work-in-Progress Account\" and \"Istisna'a Costs Account\" as accounts where \"Istisna'a contract costs are accumulated.\" (Page 402)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The terminology (\"work-in-progress,\" \"costs account\") and the measurement basis (\"expected additional cost to complete\") are clearly rooted in tangible construction/manufacturing. While these concepts can be *adapted* to software, the standard doesn't provide specific guidance on *how*. Accumulating \"costs\" for software involves tracking personnel time, computing resources, software licenses, data acquisition, etc., which differs significantly from tracking raw materials or factory labor. Estimating the \"expected additional cost to complete\" a large, complex AI software project is often highly uncertain, especially in the early or mid-stages, due to evolving requirements, unforeseen technical challenges, or performance targets that require extensive iteration.\n    *   **Why this is an issue in the trigger scenario:** The lack of specific guidance makes applying the accounting methods (Percentage-of-Completion, which relies heavily on cost estimation - Appendix E, Page 400) difficult and subjective for AI software. How do you reliably estimate the cost to complete an AI model's training or optimize its performance? This uncertainty makes the preferred Percentage-of-Completion method less applicable and potentially forces the use of the less informative Completed-Contract method (2/3/1/2), which delays revenue/profit recognition until completion, not reflecting the economic activity during the development period.

The current wording of FAS 10 on 'well-defined \n                              subject matter' and 'determination of cost' is causing uncertainty for intangible assets \n                              like software development.",
        "review_analysis": "Okay, reviewing AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 10 on Istisna'a and Parallel Istisna'a in the context of developing a large-scale AI software platform highlights several areas where the standard, primarily drafted with tangible manufacturing or construction in mind, might require enhancement to adequately address intangible assets like software.\n\nHere are the detailed findings based on the provided text and the trigger scenario:\n\n1.  **Analysis of Section 4/1/1 - Al-Masnoo' (Subject Matter) Specifications**\n    *   **Specific Clause:** \"4/1/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019 must be known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its: a) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.; b) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.; c) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications; and d) Quantity.\" (Page 390)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The requirement to specify Al-Masnoo' by \"Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity,\" with examples focused on physical goods (car, airplane, house), presents ambiguity when applied to complex, large-scale intangible assets like AI software. While software has \"Kind\" (e.g., AI platform), \"Type\" (e.g., natural language processing AI), and arguably \"Quality\" (performance metrics, features), defining \"Quantity\" is not straightforward. More significantly, specifying *all* aspects (\"removing any lack of knowledge\") of a novel, large-scale AI platform upfront, according to \"established tables of specifications,\" is often impractical or impossible due to the inherent nature of software development, which involves iterative design, feature evolution, and performance tuning based on testing and data.\n    *   **Why this is an issue in the trigger scenario:** Developing a large-scale AI software platform is an inherently complex and often iterative process. The final \"product\" (Al-Masnoo') might evolve as development progresses, new data emerges, or technological breakthroughs occur. Requiring the same level of precise, upfront specification as a physical object like a car or house can be a barrier or lead to unrealistic contractual obligations for software. The standard doesn't provide specific guidance on how to define and specify intangible subject matter to meet the Shari'a requirement of avoiding *gharar* (uncertainty) in a way that aligns with modern software development methodologies.\n    *   **Sections needing enhancement:** Section 4/1/1 needs expansion or clarification to provide specific guidelines on defining and specifying intangible Al-Masnoo', including how Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity should be interpreted for software, and how to handle the iterative nature of development while maintaining Shari'a compliance regarding *gharar*.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Section 2/1(a) - Istisna'a Costs (Exclusion of R&D)**\n    *   **Specific Clause:** \"Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, **research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs.**\" (Page 368)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The explicit exclusion of \"research and development costs\" is a significant gap when the subject matter is a large-scale AI software platform. Software development, especially for cutting-edge AI, is fundamentally a form of research and development. The majority of the costs associated with building an AI platform (developer salaries, data acquisition and processing, training computational resources, algorithm design, testing) would likely fall under a broad interpretation of R&D or development costs.\n    *   **Why this is an issue in the trigger scenario:** If R&D/development costs are excluded from Istisna'a contract costs, the accounting under FAS 10 would not reflect the true economic cost of developing the AI software. This would lead to an understatement of the asset (Istisna'a work-in-progress) and a misrepresentation of the project's profitability or loss. The core \"production\" cost of software *is* the development cost, which the standard currently prohibits from inclusion. This seems to stem from a traditional view of manufacturing costs (raw materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead) that doesn't translate well to knowledge work like software engineering.\n    *   **Sections needing enhancement:** Section 2/1(a) needs a fundamental re-evaluation or clarification regarding the treatment of development costs for intangible assets like software. It should provide guidance on which specific costs related to software engineering, data science, algorithm development, testing, etc., *can* and *should* be capitalized as Istisna'a costs when the subject matter is software, effectively distinguishing these from general, non-contract-specific R&D.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Sections 2/1(b), 2/2(a), 2/4(a), Appendix F - Cost and Work-in-Progress Accounts & Measurement**\n    *   **Specific Clauses:**\n        *   2/1(b): \"Istisna\u2019a costs incurred... shall be recognized in an Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress account...\" (Page 368)\n        *   2/2(a): In parallel Istisna'a, \"costs... will be debited to Istisna\u2019a costs account...\" (Page 369)\n        *   2/4(a): \"Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress shall be measured and reported... at a value not exceeding its cash equivalent value (i.e., the difference between the contract price and the expected additional cost to complete the contract).\" (Page 372)\n        *   Appendix F Definitions: Defines \"Istisna'a Work-in-Progress Account\" and \"Istisna'a Costs Account\" as accounts where \"Istisna'a contract costs are accumulated.\" (Page 402)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The terminology (\"work-in-progress,\" \"costs account\") and the measurement basis (\"expected additional cost to complete\") are clearly rooted in tangible construction/manufacturing. While these concepts can be *adapted* to software, the standard doesn't provide specific guidance on *how*. Accumulating \"costs\" for software involves tracking personnel time, computing resources, software licenses, data acquisition, etc., which differs significantly from tracking raw materials or factory labor. Estimating the \"expected additional cost to complete\" a large, complex AI software project is often highly uncertain, especially in the early or mid-stages, due to evolving requirements, unforeseen technical challenges, or performance targets that require extensive iteration.\n    *   **Why this is an issue in the trigger scenario:** The lack of specific guidance makes applying the accounting methods (Percentage-of-Completion, which relies heavily on cost estimation - Appendix E, Page 400) difficult and subjective for AI software. How do you reliably estimate the cost to complete an AI model's training or optimize its performance? This uncertainty makes the preferred Percentage-of-Completion method less applicable and potentially forces the use of the less informative Completed-Contract method (2/3/1/2), which delays revenue/profit recognition until completion, not reflecting the economic activity during the development period. The terminology itself could be refined or supplemented to better fit intangible development.\n    *   **Sections needing enhancement:** Sections 2/1(b), 2/2(a), 2/4(a), and Appendix F definitions need supplementary guidance on how to interpret and apply the concepts of \"costs,\" \"work-in-progress,\" and \"cost to complete\" in the context of intangible asset development like software. This includes detailing the types of costs that should be accumulated and providing acceptable methods for estimating the percentage of completion and cost to complete for software projects, acknowledging the inherent uncertainties.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Appendix (C) Juristic Rules - Footnote 7**\n    *   **Specific Clause:** Footnote (7) on page 389 states: \"The subject matter may be a commodity, service or both.\"\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** While this footnote acknowledges the possibility of Istisna'a applying to services or a combination, the main body of the standard and its examples are heavily focused on physical commodities (\"manufacturing,\" \"car, airoplane or house\").

        "enhancement_proposal": "```\n# Proposal 1: Clarifying Specification Requirements for Intangible Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe current requirements for specifying Al-Masnoo' (subject matter) in Section 4/1/1 are framed using examples of tangible assets (cars, houses) and require specification to the extent of \"removing any lack of knowledge\" regarding Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity. This level of upfront, precise specification is often impractical or impossible for complex, novel intangible assets like large-scale software, especially AI platforms, which involve iterative development and evolving requirements, creating ambiguity and potential barriers to applying Istisna'a to such projects.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\n4. Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a\n(11)\nFor the validity of Istisna\u2019a, the following rules should be fulfilled:\n4/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019\n4/1/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019 must be known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its:\na) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.;\nb) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.;\nc) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications; and\nd) Quantity.\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n4. Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a\n(11)\nFor the validity of Istisna\u2019a, the following rules should be fulfilled:\n4/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019\n4/1/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019 must be known and specified to the extent of removing any significant lack of knowledge (gharar) of its essential characteristics. For tangible assets, this typically includes:\na) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.;\nb) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.;\nc) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications; and\nd) Quantity.\nWhen Al-Masnoo\u2019 is an intangible asset or service, such as software, the specification requirements shall be applied considering the nature of the asset and the development process. Specification should focus on defining the core functionalities, performance criteria, key features, and scope of work sufficient to mitigate significant uncertainty (gharar) regarding the subject matter. While initial specifications should be detailed, the contract may incorporate mechanisms for refining certain aspects of Type, Quality, or scope during the development lifecycle, provided that the core agreement remains clear and any changes are managed through agreed-upon change order procedures. The concept of \"Quantity\" for intangible assets shall be interpreted in terms of defined deliverables, user capacity, processing capability, or other relevant metrics appropriate to the asset.\n\n## Rationale\nThis enhancement clarifies that while the principle of clear specification remains vital to avoid *gharar*, the *method* of specification should be adaptable to the nature of the asset. It explicitly includes intangible assets like software and provides guidance on how Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity might be interpreted in this context, focusing on functionalities, performance, and scope. It acknowledges the iterative nature of software development by allowing for specification refinement within a controlled change management framework, which is crucial for complex projects like AI platforms, without compromising the fundamental requirement to avoid significant uncertainty about the core subject matter. This makes the standard more applicable and practical for modern intangible asset development.\n\n```\n# Proposal 2: Clarifying Treatment of Development Costs for Intangible Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nSection 2/1(a) explicitly excludes \"research and development costs\" from Istisna'a contract costs. For the development of complex intangible assets like AI software, the primary costs are inherently related to development activities (software engineering, data science, algorithm training, etc.). Excluding these costs prevents the accurate reflection of the true cost of production for intangible Al-Masnoo', leading to an understatement of the Istisna'a asset and misrepresentation of project profitability.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\n2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)\n2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs\na) Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs. (para. 2)\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)\n2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs\na) Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs directly attributable to producing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, and research costs not specifically related to the Istisna\u2019a contract shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs. For intangible assets such as software, costs directly related to the design, development, coding, testing, and deployment activities necessary to produce Al-Masnoo\u2019 according to contract specifications shall be included as Istisna\u2019a contract costs. This includes costs such as personnel directly involved in development, computing resources used for development and testing, and direct software licenses required for the project. (para. 2)\n\n## Rationale\nThis enhancement distinguishes between general, non-contract-specific research costs and the specific development costs incurred to produce the contracted Al-Masnoo', particularly for intangible assets like software. It clarifies that costs directly attributable to the development lifecycle of the software (design, coding, testing, etc.) *are* considered Istisna'a costs. This aligns the accounting treatment with the economic reality of software development projects structured as Istisna'a, ensuring that the asset (work-in-progress) and project costs are properly measured and reported, thus providing more relevant financial information.\n\n```\n# Proposal 3: Adapting Cost Accumulation and Measurement Guidance for Intangible Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe terminology and examples used in sections dealing with cost accumulation (2/1(b), 2/2(a), Appendix F) and measurement (2/4(a)) are primarily geared towards tangible assets and construction (\"work-in-progress,\" \"cost to complete\"). While the concepts are adaptable, the standard lacks specific guidance on how to apply these to intangible assets like software. Estimating the \"cost to complete\" complex software projects can be highly uncertain, making the preferred Percentage-of-Completion method challenging to apply reliably.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\n2/1(b) Istisna\u2019a costs incurred during a financial period... shall be recognized in an Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress account... (In case of parallel Istisna\u2019a, this account shall be called Istisna\u2019a costs account...)... (para. 3)\n2/2(a) When a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists, the costs of Istisna\u2019a include the price fixed in the parallel Istisna\u2019a contract (direct costs)... these will be debited to Istisna\u2019a costs account... (para. 5)\n2/4(a) In the event of applying the percentage of completion method... Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress shall be measured and reported... at a value not exceeding its cash equivalent value (i.e., the difference between the contract price and the expected additional cost to complete the contract). (para. 19)\nAppendix (F) Definitions:\nIstisna\u2019a Work-in-Progress Account: This is an asset account in which the Istisna\u2019a contract costs are accumulated...\nIstisna\u2019a Costs Account: This is an asset account used when a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists. It accumulates progress billings made by the subcontractor...\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n2/1(b) Istisna\u2019a costs incurred during a financial period, as defined in 2/1(a), as well as pre-contract costs as described in (c) below, shall be recognized in an Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress account, and reported under assets in the statement of financial position of the Islamic bank. (In case of parallel Istisna\u2019a, this account shall be called Istisna\u2019a costs account as stated in 2/2 a). For intangible assets like software, the accumulation of costs in the work-in-progress account shall reflect the direct and indirect costs incurred in the development lifecycle. Amounts billed to Al-Mustasni\u2019 will be debited to Istisna\u2019a accounts receivable account and credited to an Istisna\u2019a billings account. (para. 3)\n2/2(a) When a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists, the costs of Istisna\u2019a include the price fixed in the parallel Istisna\u2019a contract (direct costs), together with indirect costs including any pre-contract costs as described in 2/1(c). For parallel Istisna\u2019a involving intangible assets like software development by a subcontractor, the costs accumulated shall include the amounts billed by the subcontractor for the agreed-upon development work. When the subcontractor bills the Islamic bank for contract costs, these will be debited to Istisna\u2019a costs account and credited to the subcontractor\u2019s Al-Sani\u2019 account under Istisna\u2019a accounts payable. The Istisna\u2019a costs account shall be reported under assets in the statement of financial position of the Islamic bank. (para. 5)\n2/4(a) In the event of applying the percentage of completion method for the recognition of Istisna\u2019a revenue and profit, Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress shall be measured and reported in the statement of financial position of the Islamic bank at a value not exceeding its cash equivalent value (i.e., the difference between the contract price and the expected additional cost to complete the contract). For intangible assets like software, estimating the percentage of completion and the expected additional cost to complete the contract requires reliable methods appropriate for development projects, such as milestones achieved, input measures (e.g., labor hours or costs incurred relative to total estimated costs), or output measures (e.g., completion of specific modules or features). The method used must be applied consistently and the basis for estimation disclosed. (para. 19)\nAppendix (F) Definitions:\nIstisna\u2019a Work-in-Progress Account: This is an asset account in which the Istisna\u2019a contract costs are accumulated. For intangible assets, these costs represent the cumulative investment in the development of Al-Masnoo\u2019 according to contract specifications. When the percentage-of-completion method is used, a portion of Istisna\u2019a profit commensurate with the work completed during a financial period is also debited to this account.\nIstisna\u2019a Costs Account: This is an asset account used when a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists. It accumulates progress billings made by the subcontractor for work on the Istisna\u2019a subject matter. For intangible assets, this account accumulates costs incurred by the subcontractor for the development of Al-Masnoo\u2019. A portion of the Istisna\u2019a profit commensurate with the work completed during a financial period is also debited to this account.\n\n## Rationale\nThese modifications explicitly incorporate intangible assets into the descriptions of cost accumulation and measurement. They clarify that \"work-in-progress\" and \"costs\" accounts for software accumulate development-related costs. Crucially, the enhancement to 2/4(a) provides examples of acceptable methods for estimating percentage of completion and cost to complete for software projects, acknowledging the need for methods suitable for development rather than just physical construction. This provides practical guidance for applying the standard's accounting methods to intangible assets and addresses the uncertainty issue highlighted by the reviewer.\n\n```\n# Proposal 4: Explicitly Integrating Intangible Assets into the Standard's Scope and Principles\n\n## Issue Identified\nWhile Footnote 7 mentions that Al-Masnoo' can be a service or both commodity and service, the main body and detailed rules of the standard are predominantly framed around tangible manufacturing/construction, creating a disconnect and leaving users uncertain about the full applicability and interpretation of the rules for intangible assets like software.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nAppendix (C)\nJuristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n2. Definition\nIstisna\u2019a is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller), whereby Al-Sani\u2019- based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured or otherwise acquired Al-Masnoo\u2019 (7) (the subject matter of the contract) according to the specifications and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be in advance, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time.\n(7) The subject matter may be a commodity, service or both.\n\nFinancial Accounting Standard No. (10): Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n368\nStatement of the Standard\n1. Scope of the Standard\nThis standard addresses the accounting rules of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a contracts in the financial statements of Islamic banks relating to measuring and recognizing the costs and revenues from Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a, the gains and losses accruing therefrom, and their presentation and disclosure in the financial statements of the Islamic bank.\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\nAppendix (C)\nJuristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n2. Definition\nIstisna\u2019a is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller), whereby Al-Sani\u2019- based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured, developed, constructed, or otherwise acquired Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract), which may be a tangible commodity, an intangible asset (such as software), a service, or a combination thereof, according to the specifications and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be in advance, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time. It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide either the raw material or the labour (or the intellectual property/development effort in the case of intangible assets).\n\nFinancial Accounting Standard No. (10): Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n368\nStatement of the Standard\n1. Scope of the Standard\nThis standard addresses the accounting rules of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a contracts in the financial statements of Islamic banks relating to measuring and recognizing the costs and revenues from Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a, the gains and losses accruing therefrom, and their presentation and disclosure in the financial statements of the Islamic bank. The standard applies to Istisna\u2019a contracts where the subject matter (Al-Masnoo\u2019) is a tangible commodity, an intangible asset (such as software), a service, or a combination thereof, that is manufactured, developed, or constructed according to specific requirements.\n\n## Rationale\nThis enhancement moves the acknowledgement of intangible assets and services from a footnote into the main text of the definition and the scope of the standard. By explicitly mentioning intangible assets like software and the processes of \"development\" alongside \"manufacturing\" and \"construction,\" it clearly establishes the standard's intended applicability to such projects from the outset. This provides a stronger foundation for interpreting the subsequent, more detailed rules in the context of intangible assets and reinforces the need for the specific guidance provided in the other proposals. It also slightly refines the condition regarding Al-Sani's contribution to better fit intangible development.\n```"

Specification should focus on defining the core functionalities, performance criteria, key features, and scope of work sufficient to mitigate significant uncertainty (gharar) regarding the subject matter. While initial specifications should be detailed, the contract may incorporate mechanisms for refining certain aspects of Type, Quality, or scope during the development lifecycle, provided that the core agreement remains clear and any changes are managed through agreed-upon change order procedures. The concept of \"Quantity\" for intangible assets shall be interpreted in terms of defined deliverables, user capacity, processing capability, or other relevant metrics appropriate to the asset.\n\n## Rationale\nThis enhancement clarifies that while the principle of clear specification remains vital to avoid *gharar*, the *method* of specification should be adaptable to the nature of the asset. It explicitly includes intangible assets like software and provides guidance on how Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity might be interpreted in this context, focusing on functionalities, performance, and scope. It acknowledges the iterative nature of software development by allowing for specification refinement within a controlled change management framework, which is crucial for complex projects like AI platforms, without compromising the fundamental requirement to avoid significant uncertainty about the core subject matter. This makes the standard more applicable and practical for modern intangible asset development.\n\n```\n# Proposal 2: Clarifying Treatment of Development Costs for Intangible Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nSection 2/1(a) explicitly excludes \"research and development costs\" from Istisna'a contract costs. For the development of complex intangible assets like AI software, the primary costs are inherently related to development activities (software engineering, data science, algorithm training, etc.). Excluding these costs prevents the accurate reflection of the true cost of production for intangible Al-Masnoo', leading to an understatement of the Istisna'a asset and misrepresentation of project profitability.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\n2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)\n2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs\na) Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs. (para. 2)\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)\n2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs\na) Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs directly attributable to producing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, and research costs not specifically related to the Istisna\u2019a contract shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs. For intangible assets such as software, costs directly related to the design, development, coding, testing, and deployment activities necessary to produce Al-Masnoo\u2019 according to contract specifications shall be included as Istisna\u2019a contract costs. This includes costs such as personnel directly involved in development, computing resources used for development and testing, and direct software licenses required for the project. (para. 2)\n\n## Rationale\nThis enhancement distinguishes between general, non-contract-specific research costs and the specific development costs incurred to produce the contracted Al-Masnoo', particularly for intangible assets like software. It clarifies that costs directly attributable to the development lifecycle of the software (design, coding, testing, etc.) *are* considered Istisna'a costs. This aligns the accounting treatment with the economic reality of software development projects structured as Istisna'a, ensuring that the asset (work-in-progress) and project costs are properly measured and reported, thus providing more relevant financial information.\n\n```\n# Proposal 3: Adapting Cost Accumulation and Measurement Guidance for Intangible Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe terminology and examples used in sections dealing with cost accumulation (2/1(b), 2/2(a), Appendix F) and measurement (2/4(a)) are primarily geared towards tangible assets and construction (\"work-in-progress,\" \"cost to complete\"). While the concepts are adaptable, the standard lacks specific guidance on how to apply these to intangible assets like software. Estimating the \"cost to complete\" complex software projects can be highly uncertain, making the preferred Percentage-of-Completion method challenging to apply reliably.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\n2/1(b) Istisna\u2019a costs incurred during a financial period... shall be recognized in an Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress account... (In case of parallel Istisna\u2019a, this account shall be called Istisna\u2019a costs account...)... (para. 3)\n2/2(a) When a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists, the costs of Istisna\u2019a include the price fixed in the parallel Istisna\u2019a contract (direct costs)... these will be debited to Istisna\u2019a costs account... (para. 5)\n2/4(a) In the event of applying the percentage of completion method... Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress shall be measured and reported... at a value not exceeding its cash equivalent value (i.e., the difference between the contract price and the expected additional cost to complete the contract). (para. 19)\nAppendix (F) Definitions:\nIstisna\u2019a Work-in-Progress Account: This is an asset account in which the Istisna\u2019a contract costs are accumulated...\nIstisna\u2019a Costs Account: This is an asset account used when a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists. It accumulates progress billings made by the subcontractor...\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n2/1(b) Istisna\u2019a costs incurred during a financial period, as defined in 2/1(a), as well as pre-contract costs as described in (c) below, shall be recognized in an Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress account, and reported under assets in the statement of financial position of the Islamic bank. (In case of parallel Istisna\u2019a, this account shall be called Istisna\u2019a costs account as stated in 2/2 a). For intangible assets like software, the accumulation of costs in the work-in-progress account shall reflect the direct and indirect costs incurred in the development lifecycle. Amounts billed to Al-Mustasni\u2019 will be debited to Istisna\u2019a accounts receivable account and credited to an Istisna\u2019a billings account. (para. 3)\n2/2(a) When a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists, the costs of Istisna\u2019a include the price fixed in the parallel Istisna\u2019a contract (direct costs), together with indirect costs including any pre-contract costs as described in 2/1(c). For parallel Istisna\u2019a involving intangible assets like software development by a subcontractor, the costs accumulated shall include the amounts billed by the subcontractor for the agreed-upon development work. When the subcontractor bills the Islamic bank for contract costs, these will be debited to Istisna\u2019a costs account and credited to the subcontractor\u2019s Al-Sani\u2019 account under Istisna\u2019a accounts payable. The Istisna\u2019a costs account shall be reported under assets in the statement of financial position of the Islamic bank. (para. 5)\n2/4(a) In the event of applying the percentage of completion method for the recognition of Istisna\u2019a revenue and profit, Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress shall be measured and reported in the statement of financial position of the Islamic bank at a value not exceeding its cash equivalent value (i.e., the difference between the contract price and the expected additional cost to complete the contract). For intangible assets like software, estimating the percentage of completion and the expected additional cost to complete the contract requires reliable methods appropriate for development projects, such as milestones achieved, input measures (e.g., labor hours or costs incurred relative to total estimated costs), or output measures (e.g., completion of specific modules or features). The method used must be applied consistently and the basis for estimation disclosed. (para. 19)\nAppendix (F) Definitions:\nIstisna\u2019a Work-in-Progress Account: This is an asset account in which the Istisna\u2019a contract costs are accumulated. For intangible assets, these costs represent the cumulative investment in the development of Al-Masnoo\u2019 according to contract specifications. When the percentage-of-completion method is used, a portion of Istisna\u2019a profit commensurate with the work completed during a financial period is also debited to this account.\nIstisna\u2019a Costs Account: This is an asset account used when a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists. It accumulates progress billings made by the subcontractor for work on the Istisna\u2019a subject matter. For intangible assets, this account accumulates costs incurred by the subcontractor for the development of Al-Masnoo\u2019. A portion of the Istisna\u2019a profit commensurate with the work completed during a financial period is also debited to this account.\n\n## Rationale\nThese modifications explicitly incorporate intangible assets into the descriptions of cost accumulation and measurement. They clarify that \"work-in-progress\" and \"costs\" accounts for software accumulate development-related costs. Crucially, the enhancement to 2/4(a) provides examples of acceptable methods for estimating percentage of completion and cost to complete for software projects, acknowledging the need for methods suitable for development rather than just physical construction. This provides practical guidance for applying the standard's accounting methods to intangible assets and addresses the uncertainty issue highlighted by the reviewer.\n\n```\n# Proposal 4: Explicitly Integrating Intangible Assets into the Standard's Scope and Principles\n\n## Issue Identified\nWhile Footnote 7 mentions that Al-Masnoo' can be a service or both commodity and service, the main body and detailed rules of the standard are predominantly framed around tangible manufacturing/construction, creating a disconnect and leaving users uncertain about the full applicability and interpretation of the rules for intangible assets like software.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nAppendix (C)\nJuristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n2. Definition\nIstisna\u2019a is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller), whereby Al-Sani\u2019- based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured or otherwise acquired Al-Masnoo\u2019 (7) (the subject matter of the contract) according to the specifications and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be in advance, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time.\n(7) The subject matter may be a commodity, service or both.\n\nFinancial Accounting Standard No. (10): Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n368\nStatement of the Standard\n1. Scope of the Standard\nThis standard addresses the accounting rules of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a contracts in the financial statements of Islamic banks relating to measuring and recognizing the costs and revenues from Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a, the gains and losses accruing therefrom, and their presentation and disclosure in the financial statements of the Islamic bank.\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\nAppendix (C)\nJuristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n2. Definition\nIstisna\u2019a is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller), whereby Al-Sani\u2019- based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured, developed, constructed, or otherwise acquired Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract), which may be a tangible commodity, an intangible asset (such as software), a service, or a combination thereof, according to the specifications and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be in advance, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time. It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide either the raw material or the labour (or the intellectual property/development effort in the case of intangible assets).\n\nFinancial Accounting Standard No. (10): Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n368\nStatement of the Standard\n1. Scope of the Standard\nThis standard addresses the accounting rules of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a contracts in the financial statements of Islamic banks relating to measuring and recognizing the costs and revenues from Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a, the gains and losses accruing therefrom, and their presentation and disclosure in the financial statements of the Islamic bank. The standard applies to Istisna\u2019a contracts where the subject matter (Al-Masnoo\u2019) is a tangible commodity, an intangible asset (such as software), a service, or a combination thereof, that is manufactured, developed, or constructed according to specific requirements.\n\n## Rationale\nThis enhancement moves the acknowledgement of intangible assets and services from a footnote into the main text of the definition and the scope of the standard. By explicitly mentioning intangible assets like software and the processes of \"development\" alongside \"manufacturing\" and \"construction,\" it clearly establishes the standard's intended applicability to such projects from the outset. This provides a stronger foundation for interpreting the subsequent, more detailed rules in the context of intangible assets and reinforces the need for the specific guidance provided in the other proposals. It also slightly refines the condition regarding Al-Sani's contribution to better fit intangible development.\n```",
        "validation_result": "Okay, I will evaluate each proposed enhancement to AAOIFI FAS 10 based on the provided criteria.\n\n---\n\n**Validation of Proposed Enhancement to AAOIFI FAS 10**\n\n**Overall Context:** The proposed enhancements aim to clarify the application of FAS 10, which was primarily drafted with tangible manufacturing and construction in mind, to the development of complex intangible assets, specifically large-scale software like AI platforms. This is a relevant need in modern Islamic finance practice.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 1: Clarifying Specification Requirements for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Validation Check: Shariah Compliance**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The core Shariah principle addressed here is the prohibition of Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty). Original FAS 10 (4/1/1) requires specifying Al-Masnoo' \"to the extent of removing *any* lack of knowledge.\" This is a strict interpretation aimed at minimizing Gharar. Istisna'a's validity, particularly for items not yet in existence, is based on Istihsan (juristic preference) and Maslaha (public interest/need), recognizing that some inherent uncertainty might exist compared to a spot sale. The proposed change explicitly acknowledges that for complex, novel intangible assets like software, precise upfront specification to the extent of removing *any* lack of knowledge can be practically impossible due to the iterative nature of development. By changing \"any lack of knowledge\" to \"significant lack of knowledge (gharar) of its essential characteristics,\" the proposal aligns with the nuanced Shariah view that prohibits *excessive* or *significant* Gharar (`Gharar fahish`) while permitting minor or unavoidable Gharar (`Gharar yaseer`) for Maslaha, especially in contracts like Istisna'a which are deviations from strict Qiyas. Allowing mechanisms for refining non-essential aspects (Type, Quality, scope) through controlled change orders (already addressed in FAS 10, e.g., 2/5) further mitigates potential Gharar by providing a structured process for managing uncertainty during execution, provided the core subject matter remains clear. The adaptation of \"Quantity\" to relevant metrics for intangibles is a necessary and Shariah-compliant interpretation. The proposal appears to maintain the spirit of Gharar avoidance while making the standard applicable to modern asset types.\n*   **Validation Check: FAS 10 Consistency**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal directly modifies Section 4/1/1. It introduces necessary flexibility for intangible assets while retaining the core requirement for clear specification sufficient to avoid *significant* uncertainty. It explicitly links specification refinement to change order procedures, which are already part of FAS 10 (Section 2/5 addresses change orders and additional claims). This maintains internal consistency by leveraging existing standard mechanisms. The adaptation of terminology (Quantity for intangibles) is necessary for applicability.\n*   **Validation Check: Other Standards Alignment**\n    *   **Reasoning:** Other AAOIFI standards, like FAS 4 (Musharaka), acknowledge the existence and potential valuation of intangible assets (Appendix D mentions valuation of intangible assets in Musharaka capital). While those standards don't detail Istisna'a-specific requirements, this proposal's recognition of intangible assets as valid subject matter and the need for adapted specification methods is consistent with the broader AAOIFI framework's increasing need to address modern asset types. The core principle of clear subject matter is consistent with other deferred contracts like Salam (FAS 7), although the specific requirements differ due to the nature of the contracts.\n*   **Validation Check: Practical Implementation**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This proposal is highly practical and reflects the reality of complex software development projects. Requiring \"any lack of knowledge\" to be removed upfront for novel software is unrealistic. Allowing specification based on core functionalities and performance, with mechanisms for refinement through controlled change management, is standard industry practice. This makes Istisna'a a viable and practical contract for financing such projects.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED**\n    *   **Detailed Feedback:** The proposal provides a crucial and practical adaptation of the specification requirements for intangible assets. It appropriately interprets the Shariah principle of Gharar avoidance in the context of Istisna'a for complex, iterative development. It maintains consistency with the standard by leveraging existing change management mechanisms and makes the standard significantly more applicable to modern finance needs.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 2: Clarifying Treatment of Development Costs for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Validation Check: Shariah Compliance**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The original exclusion of \"research and development costs\" from Istisna'a costs (2/1(a)) is primarily an accounting principle rooted in conservatism and matching, not a direct Shariah prohibition. Shariah requires fairness and transparency in financial dealings. In the context of Istisna'a, the Sani' incurs costs to produce the asset, which form the basis for calculating the profit (fixed contract price minus total costs). Excluding costs directly attributable to the *production* (development) of the contracted software asset would misrepresent the true cost of the asset and the resulting profit, potentially hindering transparency. The proposed enhancement correctly distinguishes between general research costs (which should remain excluded) and specific development costs directly incurred to fulfill the Istisna'a contract specifications. Including these direct development costs aligns the accounting treatment with the economic reality of creating the asset, which is necessary for fair and accurate reporting. There is no Shariah principle violated by capitalizing costs directly related to producing the contracted asset.\n*   **Validation Check: FAS 10 Consistency**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal directly modifies Section 2/1(a). It provides a necessary clarification for applying the existing rule to intangible assets. It refines the definition of excluded costs to \"research costs not specifically related to the Istisna'a contract,\" logically implying that *development* costs *specifically related* to the contract are included. This clarification maintains the structure of the cost definition while making it applicable to the specific nature of intangible asset creation. It is consistent with the overall objective of recognizing the cost of Al-Masnoo'.\n*   **Validation Check: Other Standards Alignment**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This aligns with the general accounting principle of recognizing the costs incurred to create an asset. While not directly referenced in other Islamic finance standards regarding *Istisna'a* costs, it is consistent with the need for accurate cost measurement and asset valuation, which underpins financial reporting in all contexts.\n*   **Validation Check: Practical Implementation**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is highly practical. The primary costs in software development *are* development costs (personnel, computing, etc.). Excluding these would make accounting for software Istisna'a projects nonsensical and fail to reflect the investment made in creating the asset. Including these costs allows for accurate tracking of project costs and proper valuation of the work-in-progress.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED**\n    *   **Detailed Feedback:** The proposal provides essential clarification for cost accounting in intangible asset Istisna'a projects. It aligns the standard with economic reality and allows for proper measurement of the Istisna'a asset and profit, consistent with Shariah principles of transparency and fairness in reporting.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 3: Adapting Cost Accumulation and Measurement Guidance for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Validation Check: Shariah Compliance**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This proposal primarily addresses accounting measurement methods (Percentage of Completion - PoC). Accounting methods themselves are generally not direct Shariah matters, provided they don't involve prohibited elements like Riba or Maysir. The Shariah concern here relates to Gharar in financial reporting if profit recognition is based on unreliable estimates. The original FAS 10 Basis for Conclusions (Appendix E) highlights that a \"crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy.\" Estimating \"cost to complete\" for complex software projects can be challenging, potentially introducing Gharar into the profit recognition process if methods are not appropriate. The proposal mitigates this by providing examples of *reliable methods* suitable for software development (milestones, input/output measures). This increases the likelihood that the PoC estimates are reasonably accurate, thereby reducing potential Gharar in the reported financial position and performance.\n*   **Validation Check: FAS 10 Consistency**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal modifies Sections 2/1(b), 2/2(a), 2/4(a), and Appendix F definitions. It explicitly includes intangible assets in the descriptions of work-in-progress and costs accounts. Crucially, it enhances 2/4(a) by providing specific, relevant examples for estimating percentage of completion for software projects. This directly supports and makes applicable the preferred PoC method already stated in the standard (2/4(a), Appendix E Basis for Conclusions). It clarifies how the existing accounting framework applies to this asset type without changing the underlying principles or account structures.\n*   **Validation Check: Other Standards Alignment**\n    *   **Reasoning:** Consistent with the general requirement for financial statements to provide relevant and representationally faithful information, as outlined in AAOIFI's conceptual framework (Statement of Objectives and Concepts, referenced in Appendix E of FAS 10 and Appendix D of FAS 4). Provides practical guidance for applying measurement principles to intangible assets, consistent with the acknowledgement of such assets in other standards (like FAS 4).\n*   **Validation Check: Practical Implementation**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This proposal is essential for practical implementation. Without specific guidance, applying concepts like \"work-in-progress\" or estimating \"cost to complete\" (especially for PoC) to software is difficult and prone to inconsistency. The suggested methods (milestones, input/output measures) are standard project management and accounting techniques used in software development. Providing these examples makes the standard's accounting requirements implementable for this type of project.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED**\n    *   **Detailed Feedback:** This proposal provides vital practical guidance for applying the standard's cost accumulation and measurement rules to intangible assets. By suggesting appropriate methods for estimating percentage of completion, it enhances the reliability of financial reporting for software Istisna'a projects, consistent with the underlying Shariah principle of avoiding excessive Gharar in financial representation.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 4: Explicitly Integrating Intangible Assets into the Standard's Scope and Principles**\n\n*   **Validation Check: Shariah Compliance**\n    *   **Reasoning:** Explicitly stating that intangible assets like software are within the scope of Istisna'a and defining Al-Masnoo' to include them improves transparency and clarity regarding the standard's applicability. The refinement of Al-Sani's contribution to include \"intellectual property/development effort\" accurately reflects the nature of producing intangible assets, aligning the contract's conditions with the reality of the subject matter. This enhances clarity and avoids potential ambiguity regarding the underlying asset and process, which supports the Shariah principles of transparency and fairness. No Shariah principle is violated; rather, clarity is improved.\n*   **Validation Check: FAS 10 Consistency**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal moves information from a footnote (Appendix C, Footnote 7) into the main body of the definition and scope (Appendix C, Section 2 and Section 1). This is a logical and necessary structural change to provide a strong foundation for the more detailed rules (as addressed in the other proposals). It reinforces that the standard is *intended* to cover these assets, removing any doubt arising from the current peripheral mention. It is internally consistent and improves the standard's overall structure and clarity.\n*   **Validation Check: Other Standards Alignment**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This change aligns FAS 10 more explicitly with the reality that intangible assets are recognized and dealt with in Islamic finance, as implicitly or explicitly acknowledged in other AAOIFI standards (e.g., FAS 4 regarding intangible assets in Musharaka capital). It modernizes the standard's language to reflect contemporary asset types.\n*   **Validation Check: Practical Implementation**\n    *   **Reasoning:** Explicitly stating intangible assets in the scope and definition removes ambiguity for users of the standard. It clarifies from the outset that software development, for instance, can be structured as Istisna'a and is covered by this standard, guiding users to apply the subsequent rules appropriately. This makes the standard easier to navigate and apply to relevant transactions.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED**\n    *   **Detailed Feedback:** This proposal provides the necessary foundational clarity by explicitly integrating intangible assets into the core definition and scope of FAS 10. This supports the specific adaptations proposed in the other enhancements and makes the standard's applicability to modern asset types unambiguous, enhancing transparency and ease of use.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nAll four proposed enhancements are well-reasoned, interconnected, and address genuine challenges in applying AAOIFI FAS 10 to modern intangible asset development, specifically large-scale software projects. They collectively:\n\n1.  Adapt Shariah principles, particularly the avoidance of Gharar, in a practical and nuanced way suitable for the iterative nature of intangible development.\n2.  Provide essential clarification for cost recognition and measurement for intangible assets within the existing accounting framework of FAS 10.\n3.  Improve the standard's consistency, clarity, and practical applicability to modern Islamic finance transactions involving intangible assets.\n\nThe proposals are consistent with the underlying Shariah principles of Istisna'a (fixed price, specified subject matter, Sani' provides labor/effort) and the broader objectives of AAOIFI standards (transparency, fairness, reliable financial reporting). They do not introduce Riba, Maysir, or violate other core principles.\n\nTherefore, based on the validation criteria:\n\n**Overall Decision: APPROVED**\n\n**Detailed Reasoning:** The proposed enhancements collectively represent a necessary and appropriate update to AAOIFI FAS 10 to ensure its continued relevance and practicality in addressing modern financial transactions involving complex intangible assets. They address identified ambiguities, provide essential guidance, and maintain compliance with Shariah principles and the internal consistency of the standard."

        "cross_standard_analysis": "## Cross-Standard Impact Analysis\n\nThe proposed enhancements to FAS 10 aim to modernize the standard by explicitly addressing the application of Istisna'a contracts to intangible assets, particularly software development. The proposals clarify specification requirements (Proposal 1), refine the treatment of development costs (Proposal 2), adapt cost accumulation and measurement guidance (Proposal 3), and explicitly integrate intangible assets into the standard's scope and definitions (Proposal 4).\n\nThese changes are primarily focused on adapting the existing framework of Istisna'a to a new asset class (intangibles) and the specific nature of the development process (iterative, cost structure). The core principles of Istisna'a \u2013 a contract for the manufacture/development of a specified subject matter for a fixed price \u2013 remain unchanged, as does the fundamental Shari'ah requirement to avoid significant *gharar*.\n\n**Impact on Other Standards:**\n\n1.  **FAS 4 (Musharakah and Mudarabah):**\n    *   **Synergy:** FAS 4 already acknowledges that Musharakah capital can include intangible assets (Appendix D). The explicit inclusion and detailed consideration of intangible assets in FAS 10, particularly regarding their specification (Proposal 1) and how development costs are treated (Proposal 2 & 3), provide a more detailed framework for understanding how intangible assets might be valued, specified, or accounted for if they are contributed as capital or developed within a Musharakah venture. While the accounting treatment of costs within a Musharakah differs significantly (focus is on profit/loss sharing on the overall venture), the principles of clearly defining the intangible asset's scope and recognizing the costs incurred in its creation could offer conceptual alignment.\n    *   **Contradiction:** There are no direct contradictions. FAS 4 deals with partnership capital and profit/loss distribution, whereas FAS 10 deals with a specific manufacturing/development contract and its associated asset and cost accounting. The accounting for development costs in FAS 10 (WIP asset) is specific to the Istisna'a structure and does not conflict with how costs are treated within a Musharakah partnership.\n\n2.  **FAS 7 (Salam and Parallel Salam):**\n    *   **Synergy:** None. Salam deals with the forward sale of fungible commodities that can be precisely specified by description (Kind, Type, Quality, Quantity) at the time of contract, with the price paid upfront. The subject matter is fundamentally different from custom-manufactured/developed assets in Istisna'a, especially intangible ones.\n    *   **Contradiction:** None. The adapted specification requirements in FAS 10 for intangible assets (Proposal 1) do not contradict the strict, descriptive specification required for fungible Salam goods. The accounting treatments are also entirely distinct.\n\n3.  **FAS 28 (Murabaha and Other Deferred Payment Sales):**\n    *   **Synergy:** None. Murabaha involves the sale of a specific, identified asset already owned or acquired by the seller. This is distinct from Istisna'a, which involves the manufacture or development of an asset.\n    *   **Contradiction:** None. The specification requirements in Murabaha relate to identifying an existing asset, which is different from specifying a future manufactured/developed asset in Istisna'a. The cost accounting in Murabaha focuses on the acquisition cost of the asset for resale, which is distinct from the development costs in Istisna'a.\n\n4.  **FAS 32 (Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek):**\n    *   **Synergy:** FAS 32 primarily deals with tangible assets. However, Ijarah can, in principle, apply to the usufruct of intangible assets (e.g., software licenses). The clarification in FAS 10 regarding the specification of intangible assets (Proposal 1), focusing on functionality and scope, could offer a minor synergy by providing a conceptual basis for how the usufruct of a complex intangible asset might need to be defined in an Ijarah contract to mitigate *gharar*. The explicit inclusion of intangible assets in FAS 10's scope (Proposal 4) also reinforces their relevance within Islamic finance contracts, which might indirectly support their consideration under FAS 32 for leasing purposes.\n    *   **Contradiction:** There are no direct contradictions. FAS 32 deals with leasing, while FAS 10 deals with manufacturing/development and sale. The accounting treatments are distinct (lease income/expense vs. project costs/revenue).\n\n5.  **FAS 10 (Self-Impact):**\n    *   **Synergy:** High synergy. The proposals directly address ambiguities and limitations in the current FAS 10, making it more applicable and practical for modern transactions involving intangible assets. They provide necessary guidance for specification, cost accounting, and measurement, enhancing the clarity, relevance, and reliability of financial reporting for Istisna'a contracts involving software and similar assets.\n\nIn summary, the primary impact of the proposed FAS 10 enhancements on other standards is limited but positive, mainly offering conceptual synergies related to the treatment and specification of intangible assets, particularly for standards like FAS 4 and potentially FAS 32 where intangibles may be relevant in different capacities. There are no identified contradictions with the other selected standards, as the changes are tailored to the specific nature of the Istisna'a contract and the challenges of intangible asset development, which are distinct from the subject matter and structure of Murabaha, Salam, and the primary focus of Ijarah.\n\n## Compatibility Matrix\n\n| Standard ID | Impact Level | Impact Type |\n|-------------|--------------|-------------|\n| FAS 4       | Low          | Synergy     |\n| FAS 7       | None         | None        |\n| FAS 10      | High         | Synergy     |\n| FAS 28      | None         | None        |\n| FAS 32       | Low          | Synergy     |\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1.  **Cross-Reference Intangible Assets:** While the impact on other standards is low, future revisions or guidance for FAS 4 and FAS 32 could consider cross-referencing the adapted principles for specifying and acknowledging intangible assets as outlined in the enhanced FAS 10, where relevant to those standards' specific contexts (e.g., intangible assets as Musharakah capital, usufruct of intangible assets in Ijarah).\n2.  **Clarify Scope Boundaries:** Explicitly state in the Basis for Conclusions for the enhanced FAS 10 that the specific accounting treatments for development costs and work-in-progress are unique to the Istisna'a model of asset creation and are not intended to override or conflict with cost recognition principles in other standards like FAS 4 (partnership costs), FAS 28 (acquisition costs), or FAS 32 (leased asset costs).\n3.  **Consistency in Gharar Mitigation:** Reiterate the overarching principle across all relevant standards (FAS 4, FAS 7, FAS 10, FAS 28, FAS 32) that *gharar* must be mitigated through clear specification of the subject matter, price, and terms, while acknowledging that the *method* and *level* of specification required will necessarily vary depending on the nature of the asset (fungible vs. custom-developed, tangible vs. intangible) and the contract structure (sale of existing vs. manufacturing vs. lease).

    "cross_standard_analysis": "## Cross-Standard Impact Analysis\n\nThe proposed enhancements to FAS 10 aim to modernize the standard by explicitly addressing the application of Istisna'a contracts to intangible assets, particularly software development. The proposals clarify specification requirements (Proposal 1), refine the treatment of development costs (Proposal 2), adapt cost accumulation and measurement guidance (Proposal 3), and explicitly integrate intangible assets into the standard's scope and definitions (Proposal 4).\n\nThese changes are primarily focused on adapting the existing framework of Istisna'a to a new asset class (intangibles) and the specific nature of the development process (iterative, cost structure). The core principles of Istisna'a \u2013 a contract for the manufacture/development of a specified subject matter for a fixed price \u2013 remain unchanged, as does the fundamental Shari'ah requirement to avoid significant *gharar*.\n\n**Impact on Other Standards:**\n\n1.  **FAS 4 (Musharakah and Mudarabah):**\n    *   **Synergy:** FAS 4 already acknowledges that Musharakah capital can include intangible assets (Appendix D). The explicit inclusion and detailed consideration of intangible assets in FAS 10, particularly regarding their specification (Proposal 1) and how development costs are treated (Proposal 2 & 3), provide a more detailed framework for understanding how intangible assets might be valued, specified, or accounted for if they are contributed as capital or developed within a Musharakah venture. While the accounting treatment of costs within a Musharakah differs significantly (focus is on profit/loss sharing on the overall venture), the principles of clearly defining the intangible asset's scope and recognizing the costs incurred in its creation could offer conceptual alignment.\n    *   **Contradiction:** There are no direct contradictions. FAS 4 deals with partnership capital and profit/loss distribution, whereas FAS 10 deals with a specific manufacturing/development contract and its associated asset and cost accounting. The accounting for development costs in FAS 10 (WIP asset) is specific to the Istisna'a structure and does not conflict with how costs are treated within a Musharakah partnership.\n\n2.  **FAS 7 (Salam and Parallel Salam):**\n    *   **Synergy:** None.

The adapted specification requirements in FAS 10 for intangible assets (Proposal 1) do not contradict the strict, descriptive specification required for fungible Salam goods. The accounting treatments are also entirely distinct.\n\n3.  **FAS 28 (Murabaha and Other Deferred Payment Sales):**\n    *   **Synergy:** None.

The specification requirements in Murabaha relate to identifying an existing asset, which is different from specifying a future manufactured/developed asset in Istisna'a. The cost accounting in Murabaha focuses on the acquisition cost of the asset for resale, which is distinct from the development costs in Istisna'a.\n\n4.  **FAS 32 (Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek):**\n    *   **Synergy:** FAS 32 primarily deals with tangible assets. However, Ijarah can, in principle, apply to the usufruct of intangible assets (e.g., software licenses).
