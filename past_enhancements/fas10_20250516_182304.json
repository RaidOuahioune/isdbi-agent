Since the exact text of FAS 10 wasn't provided, I will provide the *concept* or likely requirement of the original text and then the proposed addition/modification.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Area 1: Defining the \"Well-Defined Subject Matter\" for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Issue:** The standard's description of a \"well-defined subject matter\" likely focuses on tangible attributes (dimensions, materials, physical characteristics), which is insufficient for intangible assets like software. Software requires definition based on functionality, performance, architecture, etc., and development is often iterative.\n\n*   **Original Concept/Likely Text:** The subject matter of the Istisna'a contract must be well-defined, specifying its type, characteristics, quality, quantity, dimensions, and other relevant physical attributes to avoid ambiguity. (Exact wording may vary, but the focus is typically on tangible aspects).\n\n*   **Proposed Modified/Added Text:**\n\n    Add a new clause or sub-clause under the section discussing the essential elements or definition of the subject matter in an Istisna'a contract.\n\n    **Proposed Text:**\n\n    \"10.X. **Specific Considerations for Intangible Assets:**\n    When the subject matter of an Istisna'a contract is an intangible asset, such as software, intellectual property, or digital content, the requirement for a 'well-defined subject matter' shall be met by specifying its key functional requirements, technical specifications, performance criteria, scope boundaries, and acceptance protocols. Where the nature of the intangible asset's development necessitates an iterative process or phased delivery, the contract shall clearly define the initial core scope and establish a robust, pre-agreed process for managing scope evolution, defining subsequent deliverables or phases, and obtaining formal acceptance at defined stages, ensuring the overall objective and key outcomes are clearly articulated from the outset.\"\n\n*   **Rationale:**\n    *   This text provides practical guidance on *how* to define intangible assets within the framework of Istisna'a, moving beyond physical attributes to relevant intangible characteristics (functionality, performance, technical specifications).\n    *   It acknowledges the reality of modern development methodologies (like iterative or agile approaches) for complex intangible assets like software.\n    *   It introduces the concept of managing scope evolution through a *pre-agreed contractual process*, ensuring that while the specifics might evolve, the mechanism for managing that evolution is defined upfront, maintaining contractual certainty and Sharia compliance regarding the defined subject matter.\n    *   It clarifies that even with iterative development, the *initial core scope* and *overall objective* must be clearly articulated.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Area 2: Determination of Cost and Measurement of Percentage of Completion for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Issue:** The standard's guidance on cost determination and measuring percentage of completion is likely geared towards tangible manufacturing/construction (materials, labor, physical progress). Software development has a different cost structure (primarily labor, infrastructure, data) and progress is harder to measure by physical means.\n\n*   **Original Concept/Likely Text:** Costs of the Istisna'a contract shall be reliably determined, including direct materials, direct labor, and allocated overhead. Revenue shall be recognized using the percentage of completion method where the outcome can be estimated reliably. Percentage of completion is measured based on costs incurred to date, work performed, or physical milestones. (Exact wording may vary, but the focus is on traditional cost components and progress measures).\n\n*   **Proposed Modified/Added Text:**\n\n    Add a new clause or sub-clause within the sections related to accounting for Istisna'a contracts, specifically regarding cost measurement and revenue recognition (percentage of completion).\n\n    **Proposed Text:**\n\n    \"10.Y. **Specific Considerations for Cost Determination and Percentage of Completion for Intangible Assets:**\n    For Istisna'a contracts involving the development of intangible assets, the identifiable contract costs shall primarily comprise direct labor costs (including development, project management, testing), costs of allocated infrastructure and necessary third-party software licenses, and direct costs related to data acquisition, preparation, and training where applicable. General administrative costs not directly related to the contract are excluded.\n\n    Reliable estimation of the outcome and measurement of the percentage of completion for such contracts may be achieved through methods appropriate to the nature of intangible development. Acceptable methods include, but are not limited to:\n    (a) Evaluation of milestones achieved as contractually defined;\n    (b) Completion of specific functional modules or deliverables as verified through acceptance testing;\n    (c) Labor hours expended against budgeted effort for clearly defined phases or tasks, provided that this method reflects the value of work performed and is objectively verifiable and tied to specific outputs.\n\n    The method chosen shall be applied consistently and provide a faithful representation of the work performed relative to the total expected effort or deliverables required under the contract. The financial institution shall disclose the method used for determining the percentage of completion for intangible Istisna'a contracts.\"\n\n*   **Rationale:**\n    *   This text explicitly acknowledges the typical cost structure for intangible development (labor, infrastructure, data), providing clarity on what constitutes contract costs in this context.\n    *   It offers specific, practical, and reliable methods for measuring the percentage of completion for intangible deliverables (milestones, functional completion, labor effort tied to outputs). These methods are more suitable for software development than traditional physical progress measures.\n    *   It emphasizes the need for the chosen method to be reliable, objectively verifiable, and provide a faithful representation of the work done, aligning with general accounting principles for long-term contracts.\n    *   The disclosure requirement enhances transparency regarding the accounting treatment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Proposed Changes:**\n\nThe proposed enhancements involve adding specific guidance within FAS 10 to address the unique characteristics of Istisna'a contracts for intangible assets. This includes:\n1.  Clarifying *how* intangible subject matter should be defined, acknowledging functional/technical specifications and allowing for contractually managed iterative development.\n2.  Defining the typical cost components for intangible development.\n3.  Providing acceptable methods for reliably measuring the percentage of completion for intangible deliverables.\n\nThese changes aim to reduce ambiguity, provide practical guidance for financial institutions, ensure compliance with Sharia principles in modern contexts, and improve the reliability of financial reporting for such contracts.",
    "review": "Okay, acting as the AAOIFI Standards Reviewer Agent, I will analyze FAS 10, specifically focusing on the concepts of 'well-defined subject matter' and 'determination of cost' in light of the provided trigger scenario involving an Istisna'a contract for an intangible asset (AI software).\n\nGiven the prompt does not provide the full text of FAS 10, I will analyze the *concepts* required by the standard based on common understanding of Istisna'a principles and the user's description of the standard's requirements regarding 'well-defined subject matter' and 'determination of cost'.\n\n**Standard Under Review:** AAOIFI FAS 10 - Istisna'a and Parallel Istisna'a\n\n**Trigger Scenario:** A financial institution structuring an Istisna'a contract for the development of a large-scale AI software platform, facing uncertainty due to the standard's requirements for 'well-defined subject matter' and 'determination of cost' when applied to intangible software development.\n\n**Detailed Findings and Areas for Enhancement:**\n\n1.  **Section/Clause Related to: Requirement for a \"Well-Defined Subject Matter\"**\n\n    *   **Concept in Standard:** FAS 10, like other standards governing manufacturing/construction contracts (which Istisna'a fundamentally is), necessitates that the subject matter of the contract must be precisely defined at the outset. This typically involves specifying characteristics, dimensions, materials, quality, and sometimes even the purpose or location for tangible assets (like buildings, machines, furniture). The contract should leave minimal ambiguity regarding what is to be manufactured or constructed.\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The standard's language and underlying examples are likely heavily focused on tangible assets. Defining a large-scale AI software platform \"well\" at the contract's inception poses unique challenges:\n        *   **Intangibility:** Software is not a physical object. Its \"characteristics\" are functionalities, performance metrics, user experience, scalability, security features, underlying algorithms, etc. These are often harder to specify exhaustively and unambiguously compared to physical properties.\n        *   **Iterative Development:** Large software projects, especially complex AI platforms, often involve iterative development methodologies (like Agile). Requirements may evolve based on testing, user feedback, technological advancements during the development period, or the results of initial AI model training. The \"final\" subject matter might not be perfectly known or fixed on day one.\n        *   **Complexity:** AI involves complex algorithms, data handling, and integration with various systems. Defining the *exact* scope, performance under all conditions, and future adaptability requirements upfront can be extremely difficult and prone to change.\n    *   **Issue in Trigger Scenario:** The financial institution needs to ensure the Istisna'a contract complies with the \"well-defined subject matter\" rule. However, the inherent nature of developing a complex AI platform means the specifications might need to be more flexible or defined in phases. Applying a requirement designed for fixed-spec tangible goods rigidly to evolving, intangible software creates significant uncertainty regarding compliance and potential contractual disputes over scope changes.\n    *   **Recommendation for Enhancement:** The standard could benefit from specific guidance on how the \"well-defined subject matter\" requirement applies to intangible assets like software. This could include:\n        *   Acceptance of defining the subject matter through detailed functional specifications, technical architecture descriptions, performance criteria, and acceptance testing protocols, rather than just physical attributes.\n        *   Allowances for staged definition or agreed-upon processes for managing scope evolution within the framework of the Istisna'a contract, provided the core objective and key deliverables are clearly outlined initially.\n        *   Clarification on what constitutes sufficient definition for intangible outputs.\n\n2.  **Section/Clause Related to: Requirement for \"Determination of Cost\" (for accounting/revenue recognition)**\n\n    *   **Concept in Standard:** FAS 10 typically requires reliable determination or estimation of the total cost of the Istisna'a contract. This is crucial for accounting purposes, particularly for long-term contracts where revenue might be recognized over time (e.g., using the percentage of completion method). Costs usually include direct materials, direct labor, and allocated overhead.\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The cost structure and estimation process for software development differ significantly from manufacturing or construction:\n        *   **Cost Components:** Primary costs are labor (developers, project managers, QA, designers), infrastructure (cloud services, hardware), software licenses, and potentially data acquisition/preparation for AI. Material costs in the traditional sense are minimal or non-existent.\n        *   **Cost Estimation Uncertainty:** Estimating the cost of complex software development is inherently less precise than for physical goods or construction. Factors like unforeseen technical hurdles, debugging time, integration issues, performance optimization challenges, and the iterative nature mentioned above make accurate upfront cost estimation very difficult. Scope creep (even if managed) directly impacts cost.\n        *   **Reliable Measurement of Completion:** For percentage of completion, measuring progress and associated costs reliably is key. While metrics like lines of code, completed modules, or testing phases exist for software, they don't always correlate directly or reliably with the true percentage of completion or cost incurred towards the *final, accepted* deliverable compared to tracking physical progress or material usage in tangible projects.\n    *   **Issue in Trigger Scenario:** The financial institution needs to account for the Istisna'a contract, potentially recognizing revenue and costs over the development period. The standard's emphasis on reliable cost determination and measurement of completion, likely framed around tangible production, makes it challenging to apply to the uncertain and labor-intensive cost structure of AI software development. This uncertainty impacts financial reporting accuracy and compliance.\n    *   **Recommendation for Enhancement:** The standard could provide guidance on cost determination and measurement of progress specifically for intangible Istisna'a contracts:\n        *   Acknowledgement of the primary cost drivers in software (labor, infrastructure, data).\n        *   Guidance on acceptable methods for estimating and tracking costs in an iterative development environment.\n        *   Clarification on reliable methods for measuring the percentage of completion for intangible deliverables, potentially focusing on milestones achieved, functionality delivered and accepted, or labor effort expended against budgeted effort for defined phases/features, provided these measures are objectively verifiable.\n\nIn conclusion, while the underlying principles of Istisna'a can potentially be applied to intangible assets like software, FAS 10, likely drafted primarily with tangible assets in mind, contains requirements related to subject matter definition and cost determination that create significant ambiguity and practical challenges when applied to complex, evolving software development projects like an AI platform. Specific guidance tailored to the nature of intangible deliverables and their unique development processes would significantly enhance the standard's clarity and applicability in such scenarios.",

This could include:\n        *   Acceptance of defining the subject matter through detailed functional specifications, technical architecture descriptions, performance criteria, and acceptance testing protocols, rather than just physical attributes.\n        *   Allowances for staged definition or agreed-upon processes for managing scope evolution within the framework of the Istisna'a contract, provided the core objective and key deliverables are clearly outlined initially.\n        *   Clarification on what constitutes sufficient definition for intangible outputs.\n\n2.  **Section/Clause Related to: Requirement for \"Determination of Cost\" (for accounting/revenue recognition)**\n\n    *   **Concept in Standard:** FAS 10 typically requires reliable determination or estimation of the total cost of the Istisna'a contract. This is crucial for accounting purposes, particularly for long-term contracts where revenue might be recognized over time (e.g., using the percentage of completion method). Costs usually include direct materials, direct labor, and allocated overhead.\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The cost structure and estimation process for software development differ significantly from manufacturing or construction:\n        *   **Cost Components:** Primary costs are labor (developers, project managers, QA, designers), infrastructure (cloud services, hardware), software licenses, and potentially data acquisition/preparation for AI. Material costs in the traditional sense are minimal or non-existent.\n        *   **Cost Estimation Uncertainty:** Estimating the cost of complex software development is inherently less precise than for physical goods or construction. Factors like unforeseen technical hurdles, debugging time, integration issues, performance optimization challenges, and the iterative nature mentioned above make accurate upfront cost estimation very difficult. Scope creep (even if managed) directly impacts cost.\n        *   **Reliable Measurement of Completion:** For percentage of completion, measuring progress and associated costs reliably is key. While metrics like lines of code, completed modules, or testing phases exist for software, they don't always correlate directly or reliably with the true percentage of completion or cost incurred towards the *final, accepted* deliverable compared to tracking physical progress or material usage in tangible projects.\n    *   **Issue in Trigger Scenario:** The financial institution needs to account for the Istisna'a contract, potentially recognizing revenue and costs over the development period. The standard's emphasis on reliable cost determination and measurement of completion, likely framed around tangible production, makes it challenging to apply to the uncertain and labor-intensive cost structure of AI software development. This uncertainty impacts financial reporting accuracy and compliance.\n    *   **Recommendation for Enhancement:** The standard could provide guidance on cost determination and measurement of progress specifically for intangible Istisna'a contracts:\n        *   Acknowledgement of the primary cost drivers in software (labor, infrastructure, data).\n        *   Guidance on acceptable methods for estimating and tracking costs in an iterative development environment.\n        *   Clarification on reliable methods for measuring the percentage of completion for intangible deliverables, potentially focusing on milestones achieved, functionality delivered and accepted, or labor effort expended against budgeted effort for defined phases/features, provided these measures are objectively verifiable.\n\nIn conclusion, while the underlying principles of Istisna'a can potentially be applied to intangible assets like software, FAS 10, likely drafted primarily with tangible assets in mind, contains requirements related to subject matter definition and cost determination that create significant ambiguity and practical challenges when applied to complex, evolving software development projects like an AI platform.

        "rationale": "Okay, acting as the AAOIFI Standards Reviewer Agent, I will analyze FAS 10, specifically focusing on the concepts of 'well-defined subject matter' and 'determination of cost' in light of the provided trigger scenario involving an Istisna'a contract for an intangible asset (AI software).\n\nGiven the prompt does not provide the full text of FAS 10, I will analyze the *concepts* required by the standard based on common understanding of Istisna'a principles and the user's description of the standard's requirements regarding 'well-defined subject matter' and 'determination of cost'.\n\n**Standard Under Review:** AAOIFI FAS 10 - Istisna'a and Parallel Istisna'a\n\n**Trigger Scenario:** A financial institution structuring an Istisna'a contract for the development of a large-scale AI software platform, facing uncertainty due to the standard's requirements for 'well-defined subject matter' and 'determination of cost' when applied to intangible software development.\n\n**Detailed Findings and Areas for Enhancement:**\n\n1.  **Section/Clause Related to: Requirement for a \"Well-Defined Subject Matter\"**\n\n    *   **Concept in Standard:** FAS 10, like other standards governing manufacturing/construction contracts (which Istisna'a fundamentally is), necessitates that the subject matter of the contract must be precisely defined at the outset. This typically involves specifying characteristics, dimensions, materials, quality, and sometimes even the purpose or location for tangible assets (like buildings, machines, furniture). The contract should leave minimal ambiguity regarding what is to be manufactured or constructed.\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The standard's language and underlying examples are likely heavily focused on tangible assets. Defining a large-scale AI software platform \"well\" at the contract's inception poses unique challenges:\n        *   **Intangibility:** Software is not a physical object. Its \"characteristics\" are functionalities, performance metrics, user experience, scalability, security features, underlying algorithms, etc. These are often harder to specify exhaustively and unambiguously compared to physical properties.\n        *   **Iterative Development:** Large software projects, especially complex AI platforms, often involve iterative development methodologies (like Agile). Requirements may evolve based on testing, user feedback, technological advancements during the development period, or the results of initial AI model training. The \"final\" subject matter might not be perfectly known or fixed on day one.\n        *   **Complexity:** AI involves complex algorithms, data handling, and integration with various systems. Defining the *exact* scope, performance under all conditions, and future adaptability requirements upfront can be extremely difficult and prone to change.\n    *   **Issue in Trigger Scenario:** The financial institution needs to ensure the Istisna'a contract complies with the \"well-defined subject matter\" rule. However, the inherent nature of developing a complex AI platform means the specifications might need to be more flexible or defined in phases. Applying a requirement designed for fixed-spec tangible goods rigidly to evolving, intangible software creates significant uncertainty regarding compliance and potential contractual disputes over scope changes.\n    *   **Recommendation for Enhancement:** The standard could benefit from specific guidance on how the \"well-defined subject matter\" requirement applies to intangible assets like software.

      "validation_result": "Okay, acting as the Standards Validator Agent, I will evaluate the proposed enhancement to AAOIFI FAS 10 regarding the application of Istisna'a to intangible assets like software.\n\n**Proposed Enhancement Summary:** The proposal seeks to add specific guidance to FAS 10 to clarify how the requirements for \"well-defined subject matter\" and \"determination of cost/percentage of completion\" apply to intangible assets (software, IP, etc.).\n- **Subject Matter:** Define by functional/technical specs, performance, scope, acceptance protocols. Allow iterative development with pre-agreed process, initial core scope, and defined stages.\n- **Cost/Completion:** Acknowledge primary costs as labor, infrastructure, licenses, data. Allow percentage of completion based on milestones, functional module completion/acceptance, or labor hours tied to outputs. Require consistency and disclosure.\n\n---\n\n**1. Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n\n*   **Core Islamic Finance Principles:**\n    *   **Prohibition of Riba (Interest):** The proposal does not introduce any element of Riba. It deals with the definition and accounting of the subject matter, not the financing structure or return calculation itself. The fixed price nature of Istisna'a (implicitly maintained by the proposal focusing on *accounting* cost, not contract price) remains intact, avoiding Riba.\n    *   **Prohibition of Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty):** This is the primary Shariah principle addressed by the \"well-defined subject matter\" requirement in Istisna'a. The proposal acknowledges that defining intangible assets with physical attributes (as FAS 10 currently implies for tangible goods) is impractical and would *create* Gharar for intangibles. By proposing definition based on functional/technical specifications, performance criteria, scope boundaries, and acceptance protocols, it provides *practical means* to ensure the subject matter is sufficiently known and specified for intangible assets, thereby *reducing* potential Gharar. The allowance for iterative development is carefully conditioned on having a \"robust, pre-agreed process for managing scope evolution\" and clearly articulating the \"initial core scope and key outcomes.\" This structure aims to manage the inherent uncertainty of complex intangible development within a defined contractual framework, preventing excessive Gharar that would invalidate the contract.\n    *   **Prohibition of Maysir (Gambling):** The proposal does not introduce speculative elements. The contract remains based on the manufacture and delivery of a specified asset (the software).\n    *   **Asset-Backing:** The proposal facilitates the application of Istisna'a (an asset-backed contract) to a new asset class (intangible software), thus promoting asset-backed transactions in the digital economy.\n    *   **Risk-Sharing:** The fundamental risk allocation in Istisna'a (Sani' bears risk of completion and conformity) is not altered by the proposal.\n    *   **Transparency and Fairness:** Clarifying the definition of the subject matter and providing guidance on cost and progress measurement enhances transparency in the contract terms and financial reporting, aligning with principles of fairness.\n\n*   **FAS 10 Specific Principles:**\n    *   **Specification of Subject Matter:** The proposal directly addresses this (4/1/1), providing specific guidance on *how* to specify intangible assets (functional, technical, etc.) as opposed to tangible attributes. It maintains the core requirement of knowing and specifying the subject matter to remove lack of knowledge, adapting the method of specification to the nature of the asset.\n    *   **Fixed Price:** The proposal focuses on *accounting* cost and *measurement* of progress for revenue recognition (percentage of completion method, which is allowed by FAS 10 para. 11 and Appendix E). It does not change the fundamental Istisna'a requirement for a fixed contract price agreed upon at inception.\n    *   **Delivery Terms:** The proposal mentions phased delivery and acceptance protocols, which is consistent with specifying delivery terms suitable for the asset type.\n    *   **Liability and Risk:** The proposal does not alter the Sani''s liability until delivery and acceptance.\n\n*   **Overall Shariah Compliance Assessment:** The proposed enhancements are compliant with Shariah principles. They appropriately adapt the application of Istisna'a, a Shariah-compliant contract, to the context of intangible assets by providing practical means to fulfill the existing Shariah requirements (especially regarding the definition of the subject matter to avoid Gharar) in this new context.\n\n---\n\n**2. Consistency Check:**\n\n*   **Consistency within FAS 10:**\n    *   **Subject Matter (10.X):** The proposed text \"Specific Considerations for Intangible Assets\" serves as an *interpretation* and *extension* of the existing requirement in 4/1/1 (\"Al-Masnoo\u2019 must be known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge\"). It does not contradict the principle but explains how it applies to a non-physical item. The allowance for iterative development with a pre-agreed process is a necessary adaptation to the nature of software and aims to maintain sufficient contractual certainty, consistent with the underlying objective of 4/1/1.\n    *   **Cost and Percentage of Completion (10.Y):** FAS 10 already permits the percentage of completion method for revenue recognition (para. 11, Appendix E). The proposed text \"Specific Considerations for Cost Determination and Percentage of Completion for Intangible Assets\" provides specific guidance on identifying relevant costs for intangible assets and suggests appropriate measurement methods (milestones, functional completion, labor tied to outputs). This is entirely consistent with the existing standard's accounting framework but provides necessary detail for a different asset class. It aligns with the existing requirement for reliable estimation (Appendix E).\n\n*   **Consistency with other related standards:**\n    *   **FAS 4 (Musharaka):** FAS 4 acknowledges intangible assets as capital contributions (Appendix D) and requires their valuation. This shows that AAOIFI standards framework recognizes intangible assets. While Istisna'a is a different contract type, the proposed enhancement aligns with the broader recognition of intangibles within the AAOIFI framework.\n    *   **FAS 7 (Salam):** FAS 7 requires the subject matter (Muslam Fihi) to be known by specification, similar to Istisna'a. It also allows fair value measurement for non-monetary Salam capital. The proposed enhancement for Istisna'a's subject matter definition aligns with the principle of clear specification found in other asset-based contracts like Salam.\n\n*   **Overall Consistency Check:** The proposal is consistent with the existing FAS 10 framework and the principles found in related standards. It provides necessary clarifications and adaptations for intangible assets without undermining the core principles of Istisna'a or AAOIFI accounting standards.\n\n---\n\n**3. Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n\n*   **Defining Subject Matter (10.X):** The proposed method of defining software via functional requirements, technical specifications, performance criteria, etc., is standard practice in the software development industry. Requiring a pre-agreed process for managing scope evolution (change control) and acceptance protocols is also common and practical for complex projects. Financial institutions and their clients engaging in such contracts would already rely on these types of contractual clauses and documentation.\n*   **Cost Determination and Percentage of Completion (10.Y):** The identified cost components (labor, infrastructure, licenses, data) accurately reflect the typical cost structure of software development. The suggested methods for measuring percentage of completion (milestones, functional completion, labor hours tied to outputs) are widely used and accepted accounting practices for long-term software contracts in conventional accounting. Financial institutions can readily implement systems to track costs and measure progress based on these methods. The disclosure requirement is also straightforward to implement.\n\n*   **Overall Practical Implementation Assessment:** The proposed enhancements are highly practical. They align the standard's requirements with established industry practices for contracting and accounting for complex intangible development projects, making it feasible for financial institutions to structure and report on such Istisna'a contracts.\n\n---\n\n**4. Final Decision:**\n\nBased on the validation checks:\n- The proposal is compliant with core Shariah principles, appropriately adapting the application of Istisna'a to intangible assets while upholding the requirement to avoid excessive Gharar.\n- It is consistent with the existing framework and principles of FAS 10 and related AAOIFI standards, providing necessary clarification rather than contradiction.\n- It offers practical and implementable guidance for financial institutions engaging in Istisna'a for intangible assets.\n\nThe proposed enhancement directly addresses the ambiguity and practical challenges identified in the trigger scenario and provides a clear path forward for applying Istisna'a to modern intangible assets in a Shariah-compliant and financially sound manner.\n\n**Decision:** APPROVED.\n\n**Reasoning:** The proposal successfully navigates the complexities of applying the Istisna'a contract, traditionally associated with tangible manufacturing/construction, to intangible assets like software. It offers practical and Shariah-compliant methods for defining the subject matter based on functional and technical specifications, managing scope evolution through pre-agreed processes to mitigate Gharar, identifying relevant costs, and measuring progress using methods appropriate for intangible development. These enhancements are consistent with the underlying principles of FAS 10 and facilitate the use of a legitimate Islamic finance contract in the context of the digital economy."

      "sentence_diff_html": "<span class=\"deletion\">Dr.</span> <span class=\"deletion\">Abdul Sattar Abughoddah\n10.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Okay, acting as the Standards Enhancement Proposer Agent, I will draft specific text enhancements for AAOIFI FAS 10 based on the reviewer&#x27;s analysis regarding the application of Istisna&#x27;a to intangible assets like software.</span> <span class=\"addition\">The goal is to provide clarity on &#x27;well-defined subject matter&#x27; and &#x27;determination of cost/percentage of completion&#x27; in the context of intangible deliverables.</span> <span class=\"addition\">---\n\n**Standard:** AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 10 - Istisna&#x27;a and Parallel Istisna&#x27;a\n\n**Issue Addressed:** Ambiguity and practical challenges in applying FAS 10 requirements (specifically regarding &#x27;well-defined subject matter&#x27; and &#x27;determination of cost/percentage of completion&#x27;) to Istisna&#x27;a contracts for intangible assets, such as complex software development.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Proposed Enhancements:**\n\nHere are specific text proposals to address the identified gaps, structured by the area of the standard they relate to.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Since the exact text of FAS 10 wasn&#x27;t provided, I will provide the *concept* or likely requirement of the original text and then the proposed addition/modification.</span> <span class=\"addition\">---\n\n**Enhancement Area 1: Defining the &quot;Well-Defined Subject Matter&quot; for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Issue:** The standard&#x27;s description of a &quot;well-defined subject matter&quot; likely focuses on tangible attributes (dimensions, materials, physical characteristics), which is insufficient for intangible assets like software.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Software requires definition based on functionality, performance, architecture, etc., and development is often iterative.</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   **Original Concept/Likely Text:** The subject matter of the Istisna&#x27;a contract must be well-defined, specifying its type, characteristics, quality, quantity, dimensions, and other relevant physical attributes to avoid ambiguity.</span> <span class=\"addition\">(Exact wording may vary, but the focus is typically on tangible aspects).</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   **Proposed Modified/Added Text:**\n\n    Add a new clause or sub-clause under the section discussing the essential elements or definition of the subject matter in an Istisna&#x27;a contract.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Proposed Text:**\n\n    &quot;10.X.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Specific Considerations for Intangible Assets:**\n    When the subject matter of an Istisna&#x27;a contract is an intangible asset, such as software, intellectual property, or digital content, the requirement for a &#x27;well-defined subject matter&#x27; shall be met by specifying its key functional requirements, technical specifications, performance criteria, scope boundaries, and acceptance protocols.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Where the nature of the intangible asset&#x27;s development necessitates an iterative process or phased delivery, the contract shall clearly define the initial core scope and establish a robust, pre-agreed process for managing scope evolution, defining subsequent deliverables or phases, and obtaining formal acceptance at defined stages, ensuring the overall objective and key outcomes are clearly articulated from the outset.&quot;\n\n*   **Rationale:**\n    *   This text provides practical guidance on *how* to define intangible assets within the framework of Istisna&#x27;a, moving beyond physical attributes to relevant intangible characteristics (functionality, performance, technical specifications).</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   It acknowledges the reality of modern development methodologies (like iterative or agile approaches) for complex intangible assets like software.</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   It introduces the concept of managing scope evolution through a *pre-agreed contractual process*, ensuring that while the specifics might evolve, the mechanism for managing that evolution is defined upfront, maintaining contractual certainty and Sharia compliance regarding the defined subject matter.</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   It clarifies that even with iterative development, the *initial core scope* and *overall objective* must be clearly articulated.</span> <span class=\"addition\">---\n\n**Enhancement Area 2: Determination of Cost and Measurement of Percentage of Completion for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Issue:** The standard&#x27;s guidance on cost determination and measuring percentage of completion is likely geared towards tangible manufacturing/construction (materials, labor, physical progress).</span> <span class=\"addition\">Software development has a different cost structure (primarily labor, infrastructure, data) and progress is harder to measure by physical means.</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   **Original Concept/Likely Text:** Costs of the Istisna&#x27;a contract shall be reliably determined, including direct materials, direct labor, and allocated overhead.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Revenue shall be recognized using the percentage of completion method where the outcome can be estimated reliably.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Percentage of completion is measured based on costs incurred to date, work performed, or physical milestones.</span> <span class=\"addition\">(Exact wording may vary, but the focus is on traditional cost components and progress measures).</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   **Proposed Modified/Added Text:**\n\n    Add a new clause or sub-clause within the sections related to accounting for Istisna&#x27;a contracts, specifically regarding cost measurement and revenue recognition (percentage of completion).</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Proposed Text:**\n\n    &quot;10.Y.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Specific Considerations for Cost Determination and Percentage of Completion for Intangible Assets:**\n    For Istisna&#x27;a contracts involving the development of intangible assets, the identifiable contract costs shall primarily comprise direct labor costs (including development, project management, testing), costs of allocated infrastructure and necessary third-party software licenses, and direct costs related to data acquisition, preparation, and training where applicable.</span> <span class=\"addition\">General administrative costs not directly related to the contract are excluded.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Reliable estimation of the outcome and measurement of the percentage of completion for such contracts may be achieved through methods appropriate to the nature of intangible development.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Acceptable methods include, but are not limited to:\n    (a) Evaluation of milestones achieved as contractually defined;\n    (b) Completion of specific functional modules or deliverables as verified through acceptance testing;\n    (c) Labor hours expended against budgeted effort for clearly defined phases or tasks, provided that this method reflects the value of work performed and is objectively verifiable and tied to specific outputs.</span> <span class=\"addition\">The method chosen shall be applied consistently and provide a faithful representation of the work performed relative to the total expected effort or deliverables required under the contract.</span> <span class=\"addition\">The financial institution shall disclose the method used for determining the percentage of completion for intangible Istisna&#x27;a contracts.&quot;\n\n*   **Rationale:**\n    *   This text explicitly acknowledges the typical cost structure for intangible development (labor, infrastructure, data), providing clarity on what constitutes contract costs in this context.</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   It offers specific, practical, and reliable methods for measuring the percentage of completion for intangible deliverables (milestones, functional completion, labor effort tied to outputs).</span> <span class=\"addition\">These methods are more suitable for software development than traditional physical progress measures.</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   It emphasizes the need for the chosen method to be reliable, objectively verifiable, and provide a faithful representation of the work done, aligning with general accounting principles for long-term contracts.</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   The disclosure requirement enhances transparency regarding the accounting treatment.</span> <span class=\"addition\">---\n\n**Summary of Proposed Changes:**\n\nThe proposed enhancements involve adding specific guidance within FAS 10 to address the unique characteristics of Istisna&#x27;a contracts for intangible assets.</span> <span class=\"addition\">This includes:\n1.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Clarifying *how* intangible subject matter should be defined, acknowledging functional/technical specifications and allowing for contractually managed iterative development.</span> <span class=\"addition\">2.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Defining the typical cost components for intangible development.</span> <span class=\"addition\">3.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Providing acceptable methods for reliably measuring the percentage of completion for intangible deliverables.</span> <span class=\"addition\">These changes aim to reduce ambiguity, provide practical guidance for financial institutions, ensure compliance with Sharia principles in modern contexts, and improve the reliability of financial reporting for such contracts.</span> ",
