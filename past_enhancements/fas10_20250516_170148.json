I will simulate the context of the original standard text based on the analysis.\n\nHere are the proposed enhancements:\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Area 1: Explicit Scope Clarification for Intangible Assets**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The standard's scope and language are primarily geared towards tangible assets (construction, manufacturing), creating ambiguity about its applicability to intangible assets like software.\n\n**Simulated Original Text Context:** The scope section primarily discusses contracts for manufacturing, construction, or development of tangible assets.\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n**(Add a new paragraph or clause to the Scope section)**\n\n\"10.1. This Standard applies to Istisna'a contracts for the manufacturing, construction, or development of tangible assets. It **may also apply** to Istisna'a contracts for the development of **intangible assets**, such as software, provided that the subject matter can be defined with sufficient clarity as required by this Standard and the costs and stages of development can be reliably measured.\"\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n*   **Addresses Ambiguity:** Explicitly states that FAS 10 *can* apply to intangible assets, resolving the fundamental uncertainty identified in the analysis.\n*   **Provides Conditionality:** Links the applicability to intangibles to the fulfillment of key requirements within the standard (well-defined subject matter, reliable cost/progress measurement), which are further addressed in subsequent proposed changes.\n*   **Maintains Compatibility:** Extends the standard's scope without altering its core principles, acknowledging that certain conditions must still be met for the contract to qualify as Istisna'a under Shariah and for reliable accounting.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Area 2: Guidance on Defining and Handling the \"Subject Matter\" for Intangible Assets**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The requirement for a \"well-defined subject matter\" is difficult to apply to intangible assets like software, which are iterative and may have evolving specifications.\n\n**Simulated Original Text Context:** The standard likely requires the subject matter of the Istisna'a to be specified in detail (e.g., dimensions, materials, specifications).\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n**(Add a new clause or expand on the section discussing the Subject Matter)**\n\n\"XX. **Subject Matter of the Istisna'a**\n\nXX.1. The subject matter of the Istisna'a contract must be described in the contract with sufficient detail to prevent uncertainty (Gharar). For tangible assets, this typically involves specifying dimensions, materials, quality, and design.\n\nXX.2. For **intangible assets**, such as software, the subject matter is considered sufficiently defined if the contract clearly specifies the **required functionalities, performance characteristics, technical specifications, deliverables, and acceptance criteria** for the final product. While the *process* of development may be iterative, the contract must define the *outcome* and the criteria for its successful completion and acceptance by the purchaser. Provisions for agreed-upon stages of development, milestones, and mechanisms for managing changes in specifications may be included in the contract, provided these mechanisms are clearly defined and do not introduce excessive uncertainty regarding the final deliverable.\"\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n*   **Adapts \"Well-Defined\":** Redefines \"well-defined subject matter\" in the context of intangibles, focusing on functional and performance outcomes rather than physical attributes.\n*   **Addresses Iterative Development:** Acknowledges the iterative nature of software development but emphasizes that the *contract* must still provide clarity on the *final deliverable* and *acceptance*, allowing for structured flexibility.\n*   **Supports Shariah Compliance:** By focusing on clearly defined outcomes and acceptance criteria, it helps mitigate Gharar (uncertainty) regarding the subject matter, crucial for the validity of the Istisna'a contract.\n*   **Provides Practical Guidance:** Gives financial institutions concrete examples of what constitutes a \"well-defined\" intangible asset (functionalities, performance, etc.).\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Area 3: Specific Rules for Identifying, Measuring, and Capitalizing Costs for Intangible Asset Development**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The standard's cost guidance is likely geared towards tangible assets, lacking specificity for software development costs (labor, infrastructure, R&D).\n\n**Simulated Original Text Context:** Cost recognition likely focuses on direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead for tangible goods.\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n**(Add a new clause or section on Cost Measurement for Intangible Assets)**\n\n\"YY. **Cost Measurement for Intangible Assets**\n\nYY.1. Costs incurred on an Istisna'a contract for the development of an intangible asset, such as software, shall be measured reliably. These costs typically include:\n    (a) Direct costs of employee and contractor labor involved in the development activities.\n    (b) Costs of materials and services used or consumed in developing the intangible asset (e.g., software licenses, cloud computing infrastructure costs directly attributable to the project).\n    (c) Overheads that are directly attributable to the development activity and can be allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis.\n\nYY.2. **Research and Development (R&D) Costs:** Costs related to **research** activities undertaken before the development phase of an intangible asset project commences shall be expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the **development phase** shall be capitalized as part of the Istisna'a asset (work-in-progress) only if all of the following criteria are met, indicating the technical feasibility and intent to complete and use/sell the asset:\n    (a) The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.\n    (b) The intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.\n    (c) The ability to use or sell the intangible asset.\n    (d) How the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits (e.g., the existence of a market for the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself if it is to be used internally).\n    (e) The availability of adequate technical, financial, and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset.\n    (f) The ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.\n\nYY.3. Costs incurred after the intangible asset is completed and ready for its intended use shall be accounted for based on their nature (e.g., maintenance, upgrades).\"\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n*   **Specific Cost Categories:** Provides clarity on the types of costs relevant to intangible asset development (labor, infrastructure, specific services).\n*   **Addresses R&D Distinction:** Introduces the crucial distinction between research (expensed) and development (potentially capitalized) costs, aligning with common accounting principles for intangibles while fitting within the Istisna'a framework. This is particularly relevant for AI projects which often have significant R&D elements.\n*   **Provides Capitalization Criteria:** Offers clear criteria for when development costs can be capitalized, ensuring that only costs leading to a probable future economic benefit are recognized as part of the asset's cost, enhancing reliability.\n*   **Enhances Reliability:** Improves the reliability of cost measurement for intangible assets under Istisna'a, which is essential for subsequent profit recognition (e.g., percentage of completion).\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Area 4: Criteria for Measuring \"Percentage of Completion\" for Intangible Assets**\n\n**Issue Identified:** Measuring progress for intangible assets based on a fixed, tangible subject matter definition is problematic. Need criteria suitable for software development.\n\n**Simulated Original Text Context:** Percentage of completion is likely measured based on inputs (costs incurred relative to total estimated costs) or physical outputs (stage of physical completion).\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n**(Add a new clause or expand on the section discussing Percentage of Completion)**\n\n\"ZZ. **Measuring Progress for Intangible Assets**\n\nZZ.1. When applying the percentage of completion method to Istisna'a contracts for intangible assets, the stage of completion shall be measured reliably. Due to the nature of intangible assets, appropriate methods may include:\n    (a) **Input methods:** Such as costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs for the contract, provided that the costs incurred relate to work performed and the total estimated costs are reliably determinable (refer to YY.2).\n    (b) **Output methods:** Such as completion of specific development milestones or modules defined in the contract, delivery of specific functionalities, or successful completion of defined testing phases. Output methods are often preferred when the milestones or outputs can be objectively verified and directly relate to the progress towards the defined subject matter (refer to XX.2).\n\nZZ.2. The method used to measure the stage of completion for an intangible asset shall be applied consistently. The financial institution must have robust project management and documentation systems in place to reliably track progress and verify the stage of completion, regardless of the method chosen. If the stage of completion cannot be reliably measured, the financial institution shall apply the cost recovery method (zero profit method) as per [Reference relevant clause in FAS 10 for cost recovery].\"\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n*   **Offers Relevant Methods:** Provides specific examples of measurement methods applicable to software development (milestones, functionality, testing), in addition to the traditional cost-based method.\n*   **Prioritizes Reliability:** Emphasizes that any method used must be reliable and directly relate to progress towards the defined subject matter (as defined for intangibles in XX.2).\n*   **Links to Cost Measurement:** Explicitly links input methods to the improved cost measurement guidance (YY.2), reinforcing the need for reliable cost data.\n*   **Ensures Prudence:** Reaffirms the requirement to use the cost recovery method if reliable measurement is not possible, maintaining a prudent accounting approach.\n*   **Highlights Infrastructure Needs:** Points to the necessity of strong internal systems (project management, documentation) to support reliable measurement, which is crucial for complex intangible projects.\n\n---\n\nThese proposed enhancements aim to provide the necessary clarity and specific guidance within AAOIFI FAS 10 to effectively apply the standard to Istisna'a contracts involving intangible assets like AI software, addressing the ambiguities identified in the analysis regarding subject matter definition, cost determination, and progress measurement.",
    "review": "Okay, acting as the AAOIFI Standards Reviewer Agent, I will analyze AAOIFI FAS 10 (Accounting for Istisna'a and Parallel Istisna'a) in the context of your trigger scenario involving an Istisna'a contract for a large-scale AI software platform.\n\nBased on the core principles expected in FAS 10 regarding the nature of the Istisna'a subject matter and cost determination, and considering the trigger scenario involving an intangible asset like software, I can identify potential areas needing enhancement.\n\n**Please Note:** The provided \"Current Standard Text\" (\"Dr. Abdul Sattar Abughoddah 10.\") is not the actual text of FAS 10. My analysis is based on the general principles and requirements typically found in AAOIFI FAS 10 concerning the subject matter and cost recognition in Istisna'a contracts, as these are the specific aspects you've highlighted as causing uncertainty.\n\nHere is the analysis:\n\n**Analysis of AAOIFI FAS 10 concerning AI Software Development (Intangible Asset)**\n\n**1. Section/Clause Analyzed:** Concepts related to the **\"Well-Defined Subject Matter\"** of the Istisna'a contract. (Likely addressed in definitions or initial recognition criteria within FAS 10).\n\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** FAS 10, in its traditional application, is primarily designed for tangible assets (e.g., buildings, machinery, furniture). The concept of a \"well-defined subject matter\" implicitly assumes a physical object with specific, measurable dimensions, materials, and specifications that are largely fixed or clearly outlined in blueprints/designs from the outset. Applying this requirement to an **intangible asset like a large-scale AI software platform** presents significant challenges. Software, especially complex AI, is often developed iteratively, specifications can evolve based on testing and feedback, and the \"subject matter\" is lines of code, algorithms, data models, and functionalities rather than a physical structure. The definition of \"well-defined\" for such a dynamic and intangible output is ambiguous.\n*   **Why this is an Issue in the Context of the Trigger Scenario:**\n    *   **Contract Validity/Shariah Compliance:** Uncertainty in defining the subject matter precisely upfront could raise questions about the validity of the Istisna'a contract under Shariah principles, which require certainty (Gharar) avoidance, particularly regarding the subject matter.\n    *   **Scope Definition:** Clearly defining the scope of a large-scale AI platform is inherently difficult. Requirements can change, new functionalities may be identified, and the final form might differ significantly from the initial concept. How \"well-defined\" does the software need to be at contract inception to comply with FAS 10 and Shariah?\n    *   **Measurement of Progress:** Measuring the \"completion\" or \"progress\" of an intangible asset like software based on a \"well-defined subject matter\" is problematic. Unlike a building (measured by physical progress), software progress is measured by code completion, functionality delivery, testing results, etc., which are less tangible and harder to link directly to a fixed, upfront definition of the final product.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** What constitutes \"completion\" for acceptance? Meeting initial, potentially outdated specifications, or the final, evolved product? This ambiguity stems from the difficulty in defining the intangible subject matter rigidly.\n\n**2. Section/Clause Analyzed:** Concepts related to the **\"Determination of Cost\"** of the Istisna'a contract. (Likely addressed in cost recognition and measurement sections within FAS 10).\n\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** FAS 10's guidance on cost determination is likely geared towards traditional manufacturing or construction costs, focusing on direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Applying this framework to **AI software development costs** is challenging. Software development costs are primarily labor (developers, data scientists, project managers), infrastructure (cloud computing, servers), software licenses, and potentially significant research and development (R&D) elements, especially for novel AI applications. The standard may lack specific guidance on:\n    *   Accounting for the significant R&D component often present in AI development.\n    *   Capitalizing labor costs for intangible asset creation versus expensing operational or R&D costs.\n    *   Allocating shared infrastructure costs.\n    *   Handling costs associated with iterative development and changes in scope/specifications.\n    *   The inherent difficulty in accurately estimating costs for complex, novel software projects, which contrasts with potentially more predictable costs in traditional Istisna'a.\n*   **Why this is an Issue in the Context of the Trigger Scenario:**\n    *   **Cost Estimation Difficulty:** AI software development costs are notoriously hard to estimate accurately due to the novelty, complexity, and iterative nature of the work. This difficulty impacts the reliability of the Istisna'a price and potential for cost overruns.\n    *   **Cost Recognition and Measurement:** Applying traditional cost recognition rules (e.g., percentage of completion based on costs incurred) becomes problematic if the standard doesn't clearly define *what* costs are capitalizable for an intangible asset and how to account for R&D elements. This could lead to inconsistent accounting treatment.\n    *   **Asset Valuation:** The accumulated costs represent the carrying value of the work-in-progress asset. If cost determination is ambiguous for intangibles, the reported asset value may not accurately reflect the economic substance or the stage of completion.\n    *   **Profit Recognition:** Under the percentage of completion method, profit recognition depends on reliable measures of progress and total estimated costs. Ambiguity in cost determination for intangibles directly undermines the reliability required for this method.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAAOIFI FAS 10, in its current form, likely contains ambiguities and gaps when applied to Istisna'a contracts involving **intangible assets** like large-scale AI software platforms. The core requirements for a \"well-defined subject matter\" and \"determination of cost,\" while suitable for tangible construction or manufacturing, do not adequately address the unique characteristics of software development \u2013 its intangible nature, iterative process, evolving specifications, and distinct cost structure (heavy on labor and R&D).\n\nTo better address this scenario, FAS 10 would need significant enhancement to include:\n\n1.  Explicit scope clarification on whether and how it applies to intangible assets.\n2.  Guidance on defining and handling the \"subject matter\" for intangible assets, including provisions for iterative development and evolving specifications.\n3.  Specific rules for identifying, measuring, and capitalizing costs associated with intangible asset development (like software), distinguishing between R&D, development, and maintenance costs.\n4.  Criteria for measuring the \"percentage of completion\" for intangible assets.\n\nWithout such enhancements, applying FAS 10 to AI software development via Istisna'a will continue to cause uncertainty for financial institutions regarding accounting treatment and potentially Shariah compliance aspects related to certainty of the subject matter.",

Provisions for agreed-upon stages of development, milestones, and mechanisms for managing changes in specifications may be included in the contract, provided these mechanisms are clearly defined and do not introduce excessive uncertainty regarding the final deliverable.\"\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n*   **Adapts \"Well-Defined\":** Redefines \"well-defined subject matter\" in the context of intangibles, focusing on functional and performance outcomes rather than physical attributes.\n*   **Addresses Iterative Development:** Acknowledges the iterative nature of software development but emphasizes that the *contract* must still provide clarity on the *final deliverable* and *acceptance*, allowing for structured flexibility.\n*   **Supports Shariah Compliance:** By focusing on clearly defined outcomes and acceptance criteria, it helps mitigate Gharar (uncertainty) regarding the subject matter, crucial for the validity of the Istisna'a contract.\n*   **Provides Practical Guidance:** Gives financial institutions concrete examples of what constitutes a \"well-defined\" intangible asset (functionalities, performance, etc.).\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Area 3: Specific Rules for Identifying, Measuring, and Capitalizing Costs for Intangible Asset Development**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The standard's cost guidance is likely geared towards tangible assets, lacking specificity for software development costs (labor, infrastructure, R&D).\n\n**Simulated Original Text Context:** Cost recognition likely focuses on direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead for tangible goods.\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n**(Add a new clause or section on Cost Measurement for Intangible Assets)**\n\n\"YY. **Cost Measurement for Intangible Assets**\n\nYY.1. Costs incurred on an Istisna'a contract for the development of an intangible asset, such as software, shall be measured reliably. These costs typically include:\n    (a) Direct costs of employee and contractor labor involved in the development activities.\n    (b) Costs of materials and services used or consumed in developing the intangible asset (e.g., software licenses, cloud computing infrastructure costs directly attributable to the project).\n    (c) Overheads that are directly attributable to the development activity and can be allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis.\n\nYY.2. **Research and Development (R&D) Costs:** Costs related to **research** activities undertaken before the development phase of an intangible asset project commences shall be expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the **development phase** shall be capitalized as part of the Istisna'a asset (work-in-progress) only if all of the following criteria are met, indicating the technical feasibility and intent to complete and use/sell the asset:\n    (a) The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.\n    (b) The intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.\n    (c) The ability to use or sell the intangible asset.\n    (d) How the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits (e.g., the existence of a market for the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself if it is to be used internally).\n    (e) The availability of adequate technical, financial, and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset.\n    (f) The ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.\n\nYY.3. Costs incurred after the intangible asset is completed and ready for its intended use shall be accounted for based on their nature (e.g., maintenance, upgrades).\"\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n*   **Specific Cost Categories:** Provides clarity on the types of costs relevant to intangible asset development (labor, infrastructure, specific services).\n*   **Addresses R&D Distinction:** Introduces the crucial distinction between research (expensed) and development (potentially capitalized) costs, aligning with common accounting principles for intangibles while fitting within the Istisna'a framework. This is particularly relevant for AI projects which often have significant R&D elements.\n*   **Provides Capitalization Criteria:** Offers clear criteria for when development costs can be capitalized, ensuring that only costs leading to a probable future economic benefit are recognized as part of the asset's cost, enhancing reliability.\n*   **Enhances Reliability:** Improves the reliability of cost measurement for intangible assets under Istisna'a, which is essential for subsequent profit recognition (e.g., percentage of completion).\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Area 4: Criteria for Measuring \"Percentage of Completion\" for Intangible Assets**\n\n**Issue Identified:** Measuring progress for intangible assets based on a fixed, tangible subject matter definition is problematic. Need criteria suitable for software development.\n\n**Simulated Original Text Context:** Percentage of completion is likely measured based on inputs (costs incurred relative to total estimated costs) or physical outputs (stage of physical completion).\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n**(Add a new clause or expand on the section discussing Percentage of Completion)**\n\n\"ZZ. **Measuring Progress for Intangible Assets**\n\nZZ.1. When applying the percentage of completion method to Istisna'a contracts for intangible assets, the stage of completion shall be measured reliably. Due to the nature of intangible assets, appropriate methods may include:\n    (a) **Input methods:** Such as costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs for the contract, provided that the costs incurred relate to work performed and the total estimated costs are reliably determinable (refer to YY.2).\n    (b) **Output methods:** Such as completion of specific development milestones or modules defined in the contract, delivery of specific functionalities, or successful completion of defined testing phases. Output methods are often preferred when the milestones or outputs can be objectively verified and directly relate to the progress towards the defined subject matter (refer to XX.2).\n\nZZ.2. The method used to measure the stage of completion for an intangible asset shall be applied consistently. The financial institution must have robust project management and documentation systems in place to reliably track progress and verify the stage of completion, regardless of the method chosen. If the stage of completion cannot be reliably measured, the financial institution shall apply the cost recovery method (zero profit method) as per [Reference relevant clause in FAS 10 for cost recovery].\"\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n*   **Offers Relevant Methods:** Provides specific examples of measurement methods applicable to software development (milestones, functionality, testing), in addition to the traditional cost-based method.\n*   **Prioritizes Reliability:** Emphasizes that any method used must be reliable and directly relate to progress towards the defined subject matter (as defined for intangibles in XX.2).\n*   **Links to Cost Measurement:** Explicitly links input methods to the improved cost measurement guidance (YY.2), reinforcing the need for reliable cost data.\n*   **Ensures Prudence:** Reaffirms the requirement to use the cost recovery method if reliable measurement is not possible, maintaining a prudent accounting approach.\n*   **Highlights Infrastructure Needs:** Points to the necessity of strong internal systems (project management, documentation) to support reliable measurement, which is crucial for complex intangible projects.\n\n---\n\nThese proposed enhancements aim to provide the necessary clarity and specific guidance within AAOIFI FAS 10 to effectively apply the standard to Istisna'a contracts involving intangible assets like AI software, addressing the ambiguities identified in the analysis regarding subject matter definition, cost determination, and progress measurement.",

Section/Clause Analyzed:** Concepts related to the **\"Well-Defined Subject Matter\"** of the Istisna'a contract. (Likely addressed in definitions or initial recognition criteria within FAS 10).\n\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** FAS 10, in its traditional application, is primarily designed for tangible assets (e.g., buildings, machinery, furniture). The concept of a \"well-defined subject matter\" implicitly assumes a physical object with specific, measurable dimensions, materials, and specifications that are largely fixed or clearly outlined in blueprints/designs from the outset. Applying this requirement to an **intangible asset like a large-scale AI software platform** presents significant challenges. Software, especially complex AI, is often developed iteratively, specifications can evolve based on testing and feedback, and the \"subject matter\" is lines of code, algorithms, data models, and functionalities rather than a physical structure. The definition of \"well-defined\" for such a dynamic and intangible output is ambiguous.\n*   **Why this is an Issue in the Context of the Trigger Scenario:**\n    *   **Contract Validity/Shariah Compliance:** Uncertainty in defining the subject matter precisely upfront could raise questions about the validity of the Istisna'a contract under Shariah principles, which require certainty (Gharar) avoidance, particularly regarding the subject matter.\n    *   **Scope Definition:** Clearly defining the scope of a large-scale AI platform is inherently difficult. Requirements can change, new functionalities may be identified, and the final form might differ significantly from the initial concept. How \"well-defined\" does the software need to be at contract inception to comply with FAS 10 and Shariah?\n    *   **Measurement of Progress:** Measuring the \"completion\" or \"progress\" of an intangible asset like software based on a \"well-defined subject matter\" is problematic. Unlike a building (measured by physical progress), software progress is measured by code completion, functionality delivery, testing results, etc., which are less tangible and harder to link directly to a fixed, upfront definition of the final product.\n    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** What constitutes \"completion\" for acceptance? Meeting initial, potentially outdated specifications, or the final, evolved product? This ambiguity stems from the difficulty in defining the intangible subject matter rigidly.\n\n**2. Section/Clause Analyzed:** Concepts related to the **\"Determination of Cost\"** of the Istisna'a contract. (Likely addressed in cost recognition and measurement sections within FAS 10).\n\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** FAS 10's guidance on cost determination is likely geared towards traditional manufacturing or construction costs, focusing on direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Applying this framework to **AI software development costs** is challenging. Software development costs are primarily labor (developers, data scientists, project managers), infrastructure (cloud computing, servers), software licenses, and potentially significant research and development (R&D) elements, especially for novel AI applications. The standard may lack specific guidance on:\n    *   Accounting for the significant R&D component often present in AI development.\n    *   Capitalizing labor costs for intangible asset creation versus expensing operational or R&D costs.\n    *   Allocating shared infrastructure costs.\n    *   Handling costs associated with iterative development and changes in scope/specifications.\n    *   The inherent difficulty in accurately estimating costs for complex, novel software projects, which contrasts with potentially more predictable costs in traditional Istisna'a.\n*   **Why this is an Issue in the Context of the Trigger Scenario:**\n    *   **Cost Estimation Difficulty:** AI software development costs are notoriously hard to estimate accurately due to the novelty, complexity, and iterative nature of the work. This difficulty impacts the reliability of the Istisna'a price and potential for cost overruns.\n    *   **Cost Recognition and Measurement:** Applying traditional cost recognition rules (e.g., percentage of completion based on costs incurred) becomes problematic if the standard doesn't clearly define *what* costs are capitalizable for an intangible asset and how to account for R&D elements. This could lead to inconsistent accounting treatment.\n    *   **Asset Valuation:** The accumulated costs represent the carrying value of the work-in-progress asset. If cost determination is ambiguous for intangibles, the reported asset value may not accurately reflect the economic substance or the stage of completion.\n    *   **Profit Recognition:** Under the percentage of completion method, profit recognition depends on reliable measures of progress and total estimated costs. Ambiguity in cost determination for intangibles directly undermines the reliability required for this method.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAAOIFI FAS 10, in its current form, likely contains ambiguities and gaps when applied to Istisna'a contracts involving **intangible assets** like large-scale AI software platforms.

      "validation_result": "Okay, acting as the Standards Validator Agent, I will evaluate the proposed enhancement to AAOIFI FAS 10 regarding the application of Istisna'a to intangible assets like AI software.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nThe proposed enhancement addresses a critical gap in applying AAOIFI FAS 10, which was primarily designed for tangible assets, to the increasingly relevant domain of intangible assets, specifically large-scale software development like AI platforms. The proposal breaks down the necessary changes into four key areas: Scope, Subject Matter Definition, Cost Measurement, and Progress Measurement.\n\n**1. Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n\n*   **Core Islamic Principles (Riba, Gharar, Maysir, Asset-Backing, Risk-Sharing):**\n    *   **Riba:** The proposal does not introduce any element of Riba. Istisna'a, as a contract of sale for a manufactured item, naturally avoids Riba through the sale of the completed asset, not the lending of money with interest. The fixed price nature of Istisna'a is not altered.\n    *   **Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty):** This is the most significant Shariah principle addressed by the proposal.\n        *   The requirement for a \"well-defined subject matter\" (FAS 10, para 4/1/1) is crucial for avoiding Gharar in Istisna'a. Applying this to intangible, iterative software development is challenging.\n        *   **Enhancement 2 (Defining Subject Matter):** This proposal provides a Shariah-compliant adaptation by defining \"well-defined\" for intangibles based on \"required functionalities, performance characteristics, technical specifications, deliverables, and acceptance criteria\". By focusing on the *outcome* and *criteria for acceptance*, it provides the necessary clarity regarding the subject matter to mitigate Gharar, even if the development *process* is iterative. Including mechanisms for managing changes, provided they are clearly defined, further reduces uncertainty about the final deliverable and contract terms. This aligns with the spirit of FAS 10, para 4/1/1, which aims to remove \"any lack of knowledge\" about the *Masnoo'*.\n    *   **Maysir (Gambling):** Not applicable. The contract is for a real economic activity (software development).\n    *   **Asset-Backing:** Istisna'a requires the creation of a specific asset. The proposal confirms that intangible assets like software can be the subject matter, provided they are defined and measurable. Shariah permits dealing with intangible assets that are valuable and ownable (Mal Mutaqawwim). Software, once developed, fits this description. The proposal ensures the accounting reflects the development of this specific, defined asset.\n    *   **Risk-Sharing:** The nature of Istisna'a places the development risk on the Sani' (manufacturer/developer) until delivery and acceptance. The proposal does not alter this fundamental risk allocation. The Sani' (or the financial institution acting as Sani') remains responsible for delivering the specified software, bearing the risk of cost overruns or development failures.\n\n*   **FAS 10 Specific Principles:**\n    *   **Specification of Subject Matter:** Directly addressed and adapted in Enhancement 2, providing relevant criteria for intangibles.\n    *   **Fixed Price:** The proposal does not change the requirement for a fixed price in Istisna'a. While change orders are mentioned (and are already part of FAS 10, para 2/5), these are agreed modifications, not a floating price mechanism.\n    *   **Delivery Terms:** Enhancement 2 acknowledges iterative development but requires clarity on the *outcome* and *acceptance criteria*. While a precise date might be less feasible for complex software than for a building, the focus on milestones and deliverables provides defined stages of completion, which is compatible with the concept of a specified delivery *period* or key delivery points allowed in Istisna'a (FAS 10, para 4/1/3 acknowledges flexibility regarding fixing a precise date).\n    *   **Liability and Risk:** Unchanged by the proposal; liability remains with the Sani'.\n\n*   **Shariah Compliance Assessment:** The proposed enhancements are fundamentally compliant with Shariah principles. They provide necessary clarifications to apply the existing Istisna'a framework and its Shariah requirements (especially concerning Gharar in the subject matter and asset definition) to the context of intangible assets.\n\n**2. Consistency Check:**\n\n*   **Internal Consistency (within FAS 10):**\n    *   The proposed changes integrate well with the existing structure of FAS 10.\n    *   Enhancement 1 (Scope) sets the stage for applying the subsequent specific rules.\n    *   Enhancement 2 (Subject Matter) provides the necessary definition for applying recognition and measurement principles.\n    *   Enhancement 3 (Cost Measurement) provides the detailed guidance on costs for intangible assets, which is essential for applying the percentage of completion method (FAS 10 Appendix E, para (a)) and determining the value of Istisna'a work-in-progress (FAS 10, para 2/1(b), 2/4(a)). It also clarifies the existing exclusion of R&D costs (FAS 10, para 2(a)) by distinguishing between research (expensed) and capitalizable development costs for intangibles.\n    *   Enhancement 4 (Progress Measurement) provides methods for reliably measuring progress, a condition for using the preferred percentage of completion method (FAS 10 Appendix E, para (a)) and linking back to the cost recovery method if necessary (FAS 10, para 2/3/2).\n    *   The proposal clarifies existing concepts for a new context without contradicting the core accounting treatments (e.g., work-in-progress accounting, revenue recognition methods).\n*   **Consistency with Other Related Standards:**\n    *   The proposal aligns with the broader AAOIFI framework which acknowledges the existence and validity of intangible assets in Islamic finance contracts (e.g., FAS 4 Musharaka mentions intangible assets as capital contributions).\n    *   The distinction between research and development costs and the capitalization criteria in Enhancement 3 are consistent with generally accepted accounting principles (like IAS 38 / IFRS) for internally generated intangible assets. While AAOIFI standards are Shariah-driven, they often adopt best accounting practices where permissible and relevant, enhancing comparability and reliability.\n\n*   **Consistency Check:** The proposal demonstrates strong internal consistency, building upon the existing framework of FAS 10. It is also consistent with the general direction of AAOIFI in acknowledging intangible assets and aligns with relevant international accounting practices where appropriate and Shariah-compliant.\n\n**3. Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n\n*   **Enhancement 1 (Scope):** Simple to implement; a straightforward addition to the standard text.\n*   **Enhancement 2 (Defining Subject Matter):** Practical. Software development contracts routinely define functionalities, performance specs, deliverables, and acceptance criteria. The proposal aligns with industry practice. It *does* require careful and detailed contract drafting to ensure clarity and mitigate Gharar effectively. Mechanisms for managing changes (e.g., via agreed change orders) are also common in practice and are already partially addressed in FAS 10 (para 2/5).\n*   **Enhancement 3 (Cost Measurement):** Practical. Financial institutions involved in financing or undertaking such projects need robust internal cost tracking systems to distinguish direct/indirect project costs from R&D and general overhead. The criteria for capitalization are standard in accounting for intangible development and are implementable with proper project accounting.\n*   **Enhancement 4 (Progress Measurement):** Practical. Both input (cost) and output (milestones, deliverables) methods are used in software project management. Implementing these requires strong project management capabilities, clear milestone definitions in the contract, and reliable verification processes. The standard prudently requires the cost recovery method if reliable measurement is not possible, which is also practical.\n\n*   **Practical Implementation Assessment:** The proposed enhancements provide practical guidance that is implementable by financial institutions with the necessary project management and accounting infrastructure. They require adapting existing processes (contracting, cost tracking, progress monitoring) to the specific nature of software development, but the concepts themselves are not alien to industry practice.\n\n**4. Final Decision:**\n\nBased on the thorough validation against Shariah principles, consistency checks, and practical implementation assessment, the proposed enhancement provides much-needed clarity and practical guidance for applying Istisna'a to intangible assets like AI software development. It successfully adapts the core requirements of FAS 10 (especially concerning the subject matter and cost/progress measurement) to the unique characteristics of intangibles while remaining fully compliant with Shariah principles and consistent with the broader AAOIFI framework.\n\n**Decision:** APPROVED.\n\n**Detailed Reasoning for Approval:**\n\n1.  **Addresses a Critical Gap:** The proposal directly resolves the uncertainty identified in the trigger scenario regarding the application of FAS 10 to intangible assets, which is a significant and growing area for Islamic finance.\n2.  **Shariah Compliance Ensured:** The proposal effectively adapts the requirement for a \"well-defined subject matter\" to the intangible context by focusing on functionalities, outcomes, and acceptance criteria, thereby mitigating Gharar in a Shariah-compliant manner. It does not introduce Riba or Maysir and maintains the asset-backed and risk-bearing nature of Istisna'a.\n3.  **Enhances Clarity and Consistency:** The proposed text provides specific, relevant guidance for intangible assets within the existing structure of FAS 10, improving internal consistency. It also aligns with the broader AAOIFI approach to intangible assets.\n4.  **Provides Practical Guidance:** The proposed methods for defining the subject matter, measuring costs, and determining progress are practical and align with standard practices in software development and project accounting, making the standard implementable for financial institutions.\n5.  **Supports Reliable Accounting:** By providing specific criteria for cost capitalization and progress measurement, the proposal enhances the reliability of financial reporting for Istisna'a contracts involving intangible assets.\n\nThe proposed enhancements are well-structured, logically presented, and effectively address the challenges posed by applying Istisna'a to intangible assets within the strictures of Shariah and sound accounting principles."

Costs incurred on an Istisna'a contract for the development of an intangible asset, such as software, shall be measured reliably. These costs typically include:\n+     (a) Direct costs of employee and contractor labor involved in the development activities.\n+     (b) Costs of materials and services used or consumed in developing the intangible asset (e.g., software licenses, cloud computing infrastructure costs directly attributable to the project).\n+     (c) Overheads that are directly attributable to the development activity and can be allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis.\n+ \n+ YY.2. **Research and Development (R&D) Costs:** Costs related to **research** activities undertaken before the development phase of an intangible asset project commences shall be expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the **development phase** shall be capitalized as part of the Istisna'a asset (work-in-progress) only if all of the following criteria are met, indicating the technical feasibility and intent to complete and use/sell the asset:\n+     (a) The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.\n+     (b) The intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.\n+     (c) The ability to use or sell the intangible asset.\n+     (d) How the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits (e.g., the existence of a market for the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself if it is to be used internally).\n+     (e) The availability of adequate technical, financial, and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset.\n+     (f) The ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.\n+ \n+ YY.3. Costs incurred after the intangible asset is completed and ready for its intended use shall be accounted for based on their nature (e.g., maintenance, upgrades).\"\n+ \n+ **Rationale:**\n+ \n+ *   **Specific Cost Categories:** Provides clarity on the types of costs relevant to intangible asset development (labor, infrastructure, specific services).\n+ *   **Addresses R&D Distinction:** Introduces the crucial distinction between research (expensed) and development (potentially capitalized) costs, aligning with common accounting principles for intangibles while fitting within the Istisna'a framework. This is particularly relevant for AI projects which often have significant R&D elements.\n+ *   **Provides Capitalization Criteria:** Offers clear criteria for when development costs can be capitalized, ensuring that only costs leading to a probable future economic benefit are recognized as part of the asset's cost, enhancing reliability.\n+ *   **Enhances Reliability:** Improves the reliability of cost measurement for intangible assets under Istisna'a, which is essential for subsequent profit recognition (e.g., percentage of completion).\n+ \n+ ---\n+ \n+ **Enhancement Area 4: Criteria for Measuring \"Percentage of Completion\" for Intangible Assets**\n+ \n+ **Issue Identified:** Measuring progress for intangible assets based on a fixed, tangible subject matter definition is problematic. Need criteria suitable for software development.\n+ \n+ **Simulated Original Text Context:** Percentage of completion is likely measured based on inputs (costs incurred relative to total estimated costs) or physical outputs (stage of physical completion).\n+ \n+ **Proposed Modified Text:**\n+ \n+ **(Add a new clause or expand on the section discussing Percentage of Completion)**\n+ \n+ \"ZZ. **Measuring Progress for Intangible Assets**\n+ \n+ ZZ.1. When applying the percentage of completion method to Istisna'a contracts for intangible assets, the stage of completion shall be measured reliably. Due to the nature of intangible assets, appropriate methods may include:\n+     (a) **Input methods:** Such as costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs for the contract, provided that the costs incurred relate to work performed and the total estimated costs are reliably determinable (refer to YY.2).\n+     (b) **Output methods:** Such as completion of specific development milestones or modules defined in the contract, delivery of specific functionalities, or successful completion of defined testing phases. Output methods are often preferred when the milestones or outputs can be objectively verified and directly relate to the progress towards the defined subject matter (refer to XX.2).\n+ \n+ ZZ.2. The method used to measure the stage of completion for an intangible asset shall be applied consistently. The financial institution must have robust project management and documentation systems in place to reliably track progress and verify the stage of completion, regardless of the method chosen. If the stage of completion cannot be reliably measured, the financial institution shall apply the cost recovery method (zero profit method) as per [Reference relevant clause in FAS 10 for cost recovery].\"\n+ \n+ **Rationale:**\n+ \n+ *   **Offers Relevant Methods:** Provides specific examples of measurement methods applicable to software development (milestones, functionality, testing), in addition to the traditional cost-based method.\n+ *   **Prioritizes Reliability:** Emphasizes that any method used must be reliable and directly relate to progress towards the defined subject matter (as defined for intangibles in XX.2).\n+ *   **Links to Cost Measurement:** Explicitly links input methods to the improved cost measurement guidance (YY.2), reinforcing the need for reliable cost data.\n+ *   **Ensures Prudence:** Reaffirms the requirement to use the cost recovery method if reliable measurement is not possible, maintaining a prudent accounting approach.\n+ *   **Highlights Infrastructure Needs:** Points to the necessity of strong internal systems (project management, documentation) to support reliable measurement, which is crucial for complex intangible projects.\n+ \n+ ---\n+ \n+ These proposed enhancements aim to provide the necessary clarity and specific guidance within AAOIFI FAS 10 to effectively apply the standard to Istisna'a contracts involving intangible assets like AI software, addressing the ambiguities identified in the analysis regarding subject matter definition, cost determination, and progress measurement.",

I will simulate the context of the original standard text based on the analysis.\n\nHere are the proposed enhancements:\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Area 1: Explicit Scope Clarification for Intangible Assets**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The standard&#x27;s scope and language are primarily geared towards tangible assets (construction, manufacturing), creating ambiguity about its applicability to intangible assets like software.\n\n**Simulated Original Text Context:** The scope section primarily discusses contracts for manufacturing, construction, or development of tangible assets.\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n**(Add a new paragraph or clause to the Scope section)**\n\n&quot;10.1. This Standard applies to Istisna&#x27;a contracts for the manufacturing, construction, or development of tangible assets. It **may also apply** to Istisna&#x27;a contracts for the development of **intangible assets**, such as software, provided that the subject matter can be defined with sufficient clarity as required by this Standard and the costs and stages of development can be reliably measured.&quot;\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n*   **Addresses Ambiguity:** Explicitly states that FAS 10 *can* apply to intangible assets, resolving the fundamental uncertainty identified in the analysis.\n*   **Provides Conditionality:** Links the applicability to intangibles to the fulfillment of key requirements within the standard (well-defined subject matter, reliable cost/progress measurement), which are further addressed in subsequent proposed changes.\n*   **Maintains Compatibility:** Extends the standard&#x27;s scope without altering its core principles, acknowledging that certain conditions must still be met for the contract to qualify as Istisna&#x27;a under Shariah and for reliable accounting.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Area 2: Guidance on Defining and Handling the &quot;Subject Matter&quot; for Intangible Assets**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The requirement for a &quot;well-defined subject matter&quot; is difficult to apply to intangible assets like software, which are iterative and may have evolving specifications.\n\n**Simulated Original Text Context:** The standard likely requires the subject matter of the Istisna&#x27;a to be specified in detail (e.g., dimensions, materials, specifications).\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n**(Add a new clause or expand on the section discussing the Subject Matter)**\n\n&quot;XX. **Subject Matter of the Istisna&#x27;a**\n\nXX.1.

For tangible assets, this typically involves specifying dimensions, materials, quality, and design.\n\nXX.2. For **intangible assets**, such as software, the subject matter is considered sufficiently defined if the contract clearly specifies the **required functionalities, performance characteristics, technical specifications, deliverables, and acceptance criteria** for the final product. While the *process* of development may be iterative, the contract must define the *outcome* and the criteria for its successful completion and acceptance by the purchaser. Provisions for agreed-upon stages of development, milestones, and mechanisms for managing changes in specifications may be included in the contract, provided these mechanisms are clearly defined and do not introduce excessive uncertainty regarding the final deliverable.&quot;\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n*   **Adapts &quot;Well-Defined&quot;:** Redefines &quot;well-defined subject matter&quot; in the context of intangibles, focusing on functional and performance outcomes rather than physical attributes.\n*   **Addresses Iterative Development:** Acknowledges the iterative nature of software development but emphasizes that the *contract* must still provide clarity on the *final deliverable* and *acceptance*, allowing for structured flexibility.\n*   **Supports Shariah Compliance:** By focusing on clearly defined outcomes and acceptance criteria, it helps mitigate Gharar (uncertainty) regarding the subject matter, crucial for the validity of the Istisna&#x27;a contract.\n*   **Provides Practical Guidance:** Gives financial institutions concrete examples of what constitutes a &quot;well-defined&quot; intangible asset (functionalities, performance, etc.).\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Area 3: Specific Rules for Identifying, Measuring, and Capitalizing Costs for Intangible Asset Development**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The standard&#x27;s cost guidance is likely geared towards tangible assets, lacking specificity for software development costs (labor, infrastructure, R&amp;D).\n\n**Simulated Original Text Context:** Cost recognition likely focuses on direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead for tangible goods.\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n**(Add a new clause or section on Cost Measurement for Intangible Assets)**\n\n&quot;YY. **Cost Measurement for Intangible Assets**\n\nYY.1.

intangible asset (functionalities, performance, etc.).</span> <span class=\"addition\">---\n\n**Enhancement Area 3: Specific Rules for Identifying, Measuring, and Capitalizing Costs for Intangible Asset Development**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The standard&#x27;s cost guidance is likely geared towards tangible assets, lacking specificity for software development costs (labor, infrastructure, R&amp;D).</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Simulated Original Text Context:** Cost recognition likely focuses on direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead for tangible goods.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n**(Add a new clause or section on Cost Measurement for Intangible Assets)**\n\n&quot;YY.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Cost Measurement for Intangible Assets**\n\nYY.1.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Costs incurred on an Istisna&#x27;a contract for the development of an intangible asset, such as software, shall be measured reliably.</span> <span class=\"addition\">These costs typically include:\n    (a) Direct costs of employee and contractor labor involved in the development activities.</span> <span class=\"addition\">(b) Costs of materials and services used or consumed in developing the intangible asset (e.g., software licenses, cloud computing infrastructure costs directly attributable to the project).</span> <span class=\"addition\">(c) Overheads that are directly attributable to the development activity and can be allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis.</span> <span class=\"addition\">YY.2.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Research and Development (R&amp;D) Costs:** Costs related to **research** activities undertaken before the development phase of an intangible asset project commences shall be expensed as incurred.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Costs incurred during the **development phase** shall be capitalized as part of the Istisna&#x27;a asset (work-in-progress) only if all of the following criteria are met, indicating the technical feasibility and intent to complete and use/sell the asset:\n    (a) The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.</span> <span class=\"addition\">(b) The intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.</span> <span class=\"addition\">(c) The ability to use or sell the intangible asset.</span> <span class=\"addition\">(d) How the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits (e.g., the existence of a market for the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself if it is to be used internally).</span> <span class=\"addition\">(e) The availability of adequate technical, financial, and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset.</span> <span class=\"addition\">(f) The ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.</span> <span class=\"addition\">YY.3.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Costs incurred after the intangible asset is completed and ready for its intended use shall be accounted for based on their nature (e.g., maintenance, upgrades).&quot;\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n*   **Specific Cost Categories:** Provides clarity on the types of costs relevant to intangible asset development (labor, infrastructure, specific services).</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   **Addresses R&amp;D Distinction:** Introduces the crucial distinction between research (expensed) and development (potentially capitalized) costs, aligning with common accounting principles for intangibles while fitting within the Istisna&#x27;a framework.</span> <span class=\"addition\">This is particularly relevant for AI projects which often have significant R&amp;D elements.</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   **Provides Capitalization Criteria:** Offers clear criteria for when development costs can be capitalized, ensuring that only costs leading to a probable future economic benefit are recognized as part of the asset&#x27;s cost, enhancing reliability.</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   **Enhances Reliability:** Improves the reliability of cost measurement for intangible assets under Istisna&#x27;a, which is essential for subsequent profit recognition (e.g., percentage of completion).</span> <span class=\"addition\">---\n\n**Enhancement Area 4: Criteria for Measuring &quot;Percentage of Completion&quot; for Intangible Assets**\n\n**Issue Identified:** Measuring progress for intangible assets based on a fixed, tangible subject matter definition is problematic.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Need criteria suitable for software development.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Simulated Original Text Context:** Percentage of completion is likely measured based on inputs (costs incurred relative to total estimated costs) or physical outputs (stage of physical completion).</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n**(Add a new clause or expand on the section discussing Percentage of Completion)**\n\n&quot;ZZ.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Measuring Progress for Intangible Assets**\n\nZZ.1.</span> <span class=\"addition\">When applying the percentage of completion method to Istisna&#x27;a contracts for intangible assets, the stage of completion shall be measured reliably.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Due to the nature of intangible assets, appropriate methods may include:\n    (a) **Input methods:** Such as costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs for the contract, provided that the costs incurred relate to work performed and the total estimated costs are reliably determinable (refer to YY.2).</span> <span class=\"addition\">(b) **Output methods:** Such as completion of specific development milestones or modules defined in the contract, delivery of specific functionalities, or successful completion of defined testing phases.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Output methods are often preferred when the milestones or outputs can be objectively verified and directly relate to the progress towards the defined subject matter (refer to XX.2).</span> <span class=\"addition\">ZZ.2.</span> <span class=\"addition\">The method used to measure the stage of completion for an intangible asset shall be applied consistently.</span> <span class=\"addition\">The financial institution must have robust project management and documentation systems in place to reliably track progress and verify the stage of completion, regardless of the method chosen.</span> <span class=\"addition\">If the stage of completion cannot be reliably measured, the financial institution shall apply the cost recovery method (zero profit method) as per [Reference relevant clause in FAS 10 for cost recovery].&quot;\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n*   **Offers Relevant Methods:** Provides specific examples of measurement methods applicable to software development (milestones, functionality, testing), in addition to the traditional cost-based method.</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   **Prioritizes Reliability:** Emphasizes that any method used must be reliable and directly relate to progress towards the defined subject matter (as defined for intangibles in XX.2).</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   **Links to Cost Measurement:** Explicitly links input methods to the improved cost measurement guidance (YY.2), reinforcing the need for reliable cost data.</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   **Ensures Prudence:** Reaffirms the requirement to use the cost recovery method if reliable measurement is not possible, maintaining a prudent accounting approach.</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   **Highlights Infrastructure Needs:** Points to the necessity of strong internal systems (project management, documentation) to support reliable measurement, which is crucial for complex intangible projects.</span> <span class=\"addition\">---\n\nThese proposed enhancements aim to provide the necessary clarity and specific guidance within AAOIFI FAS 10 to effectively apply the standard to Istisna&#x27;a contracts involving intangible assets like AI software, addressing the ambiguities identified in the analysis regarding subject matter definition, cost determination, and progress measurement.</span> ",
