    "review": "Okay, let's analyze AAOIFI FAS 10 in the context of structuring an Istisna'a contract for a large-scale AI software platform.\n\nBased on the provided text from AAOIFI FAS 10, here are the sections that appear to need enhancement or clarification when applied to intangible assets like AI software development, given the trigger scenario:\n\n**1. Specific Section/Clause:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a, Section 2. Definition, and Appendix (F) Definitions, \"Istisna'a\" definition.\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The primary definition of Istisna'a refers to Al-Sani' undertaking \"to have manufactured or otherwise acquire Al-Masnoo'\". While Note (7) explicitly states, \"The subject matter may be a commodity, service or both,\" the core definition and the subsequent detailed conditions and accounting treatments heavily lean towards tangible manufacturing or construction. The term \"manufactured\" does not intuitively apply to the development of intangible software.\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** The scenario involves developing an AI software platform, which is primarily an intangible asset and a complex service involving design, coding, training, and integration. The standard's language, rooted in manufacturing and tangible goods, creates ambiguity about whether software development genuinely fits the \"manufactured or otherwise acquire\" criteria, despite the note about services. This foundational ambiguity affects the confidence in applying the entire standard to such a project.\n\n**2. Specific Section/Clause:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a, Section 4. Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a, specifically 4/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019 and its sub-points 4/1/1 (a, b, c, d).\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** Section 4/1/1 requires Al-Masnoo' to be \"known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its: a) Kind, b) Type, c) Quality, and d) Quantity.\" It gives examples like \"car, airoplane or house\" and specifying \"Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications\". This language is highly specific to tangible, physical goods.\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** Defining the \"Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity\" of a large-scale, complex AI software platform upfront with the same level of precision as a physical object is exceptionally difficult.\n    *   **Kind/Type:** While \"AI Software Platform\" is a kind, specifying the exact \"type\" and its sub-components (modules, algorithms) in detail upfront is challenging.\n    *   **Quality:** Defining \"Quality\" for AI software is complex. It involves not just functionality but performance, accuracy (which can change based on data), scalability, security, usability, etc. Relying on \"established tables of specifications\" is problematic as bespoke software, especially cutting-edge AI, often lacks such pre-defined, exhaustive tables. Specifications often evolve during development.\n    *   **Quantity:** \"Quantity\" for software is ambiguous. Is it lines of code, number of features, number of users supported, processing capacity? This metric needs clarification for intangible assets.\n    The requirement for such precise upfront specification, while crucial for mitigating *Gharar* (uncertainty) in tangible sales, poses a significant hurdle for the dynamic and often iterative nature of large software development projects, leading to uncertainty in contract validity from a Shari'a perspective based on this standard's conditions.\n\n**3. Specific Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, Section 2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller), specifically 2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs, point (a).\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** This clause states that Istisna'a costs consist of \"(I) Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo'; and (II) Indirect costs... General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, **research and development costs shall not be included** in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs.\"\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** Large-scale AI software development often involves significant research and development efforts, especially if it's innovative or tailored to a specific, complex problem. Excluding \"research and development costs\" from the project's recognized Istisna'a costs creates a mismatch between the actual economic cost of developing the AI platform and the cost recognized under the standard. This could lead to an inaccurate representation of the project's profitability and asset value, particularly given that R&D is an integral part of creating such an asset, not merely a general corporate overhead.\n\n**4. Specific Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, Section 2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller), specifically 2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs, point (b), 2/4 Measurement of Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress, point (a), and related definitions in Appendix F (\"Istisna\u2019a Work-in-Progress Account\").\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The standard requires recognizing Istisna'a costs in an \"Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress account\" and reporting it under assets (2/1(b)). It also requires measuring this work-in-progress \"at a value not exceeding its cash equivalent value (i.e., the difference between the contract price and the expected additional cost to complete the contract)\" (2/4(a)). The definition of the WIP account refers to accumulated costs and recognized profit.\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** The concept of \"work-in-progress\" and its \"cash equivalent value\" is straightforward for tangible assets (e.g., raw materials, partial construction). For intangible software development, measuring the \"work-in-progress\" as a balance sheet asset is less intuitive. How is the value of partially completed code, algorithms, or training data accurately determined? Furthermore, the \"cash equivalent value\" of partially completed *bespoke* AI software, which might have little to no alternative market use until fully completed, is highly subjective and difficult to assess reliably. This poses significant measurement challenges.\n\n**5. Specific Section/Clause:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules, Section 4. Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a, specifically 4/1/3 Fixing a date for delivering Al-Masnoo\u2019.\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The section discusses opinions on fixing a delivery date, noting that fixing a date might turn the contract into Salam according to some views, but other views permit it.\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** Large-scale software development, especially AI, often involves phased delivery, continuous integration, and ongoing updates rather than a single, fixed delivery event for the entire \"Al-Masnoo'\". The standard's discussion feels more aligned with the one-off delivery of a finished physical product. While fixing milestones is common in software, the concept of a single, final \"delivery date\" for a complex, evolving platform might not fit neatly, potentially causing structural or contractual issues under this clause.\n\n**6. Potential Inconsistency:** The allowance for \"service\" as a subject matter in Note (7) of Appendix C seems inconsistent with the detailed conditions for specifying Al-Masnoo' (4/1/1) and the accounting treatments (2/1, 2/4) which are predominantly framed around tangible goods and manufacturing/construction concepts.\n\nIn summary, while FAS 10 provides a framework for Istisna'a, its language, examples, and specific requirements (especially regarding subject matter specification, cost components like R&D, and WIP measurement/valuation) are heavily rooted in tangible asset production. Applying this standard directly to the complex, dynamic, and intangible nature of large-scale AI software development presents significant challenges and ambiguities that the current wording does not fully address. Enhancement would involve providing specific guidance, examples, and potentially adapted criteria for intangible assets and service-based Istisna'a.",
    "proposal": "```\n# Proposal 1: Clarify Subject Matter Scope for Intangible Assets and Services\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe definition of Istisna'a and the subsequent discussion of Al-Masnoo' (subject matter) in the standard primarily use language and examples related to tangible goods and manufacturing, creating ambiguity regarding its application to intangible assets like software or complex services, despite a note mentioning services. This uncertainty hinders the application of the standard to modern contracts involving such assets.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nAppendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n2. Definition\nIstisna\u2019a is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller), whereby Al-Sani\u2019- based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured or otherwise acquired Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract) according to the specifications and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be in advance, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time. It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide either the raw material or the labour.\n(7) The subject matter may be a commodity, service or both.\n\nAppendix (F) Definitions\nIstisna\u2019a\nIt is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 , (the seller) whereby Al-Sani\u2019 - based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured or otherwise acquire Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract) according to the specifications and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be at the time of contracting, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time. It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide either the raw material or the labour.\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\nAppendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n2. Definition\nIstisna\u2019a is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller), whereby Al-Sani\u2019- based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured, developed, constructed or otherwise acquired Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract, which may be a tangible asset, an intangible asset, a service, or a combination thereof) according to the specifications and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be in advance, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time. It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide either the raw material/inputs or the labour/effort required.\n\nAppendix (F) Definitions\nIstisna\u2019a\nIt is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 , (the seller) whereby Al-Sani\u2019 - based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured, developed, constructed or otherwise acquire Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract, which may be a tangible asset, an intangible asset, a service, or a combination thereof) according to the specifications and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be at the time of contracting, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time. It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide either the raw material/inputs or the labour/effort required.\n\n## Rationale\nThis change explicitly incorporates the terms \"developed\" and \"constructed\" alongside \"manufactured\" and clarifies that Al-Masnoo' can be a tangible asset, an intangible asset, a service, or a combination. This directly addresses the ambiguity regarding the application of Istisna'a to intangible assets like software development. By making this explicit in the core definition, it provides a clear foundation for applying the standard to a wider range of modern contracts, including those for complex software platforms, and aligns the main definition with the concept mentioned in footnote (7) but integrates it more effectively into the standard's primary text. The terms \"inputs\" and \"effort\" are added to provide parallel concepts to \"raw material\" and \"labour\" suitable for non-manufacturing contexts.\n\n```\n\n```\n# Proposal 2: Adapt Specification Requirements for Intangible Assets and Services\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe conditions for the validity of Istisna'a require Al-Masnoo' to be specified in terms of Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity, with examples and language tailored for tangible goods (\"car, airoplane, house\", \"established tables of specifications\"). Applying these precise requirements to intangible assets like complex software, where specifications are often dynamic and qualitative measures differ significantly from physical goods, is challenging and creates uncertainty about contract validity under the standard.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nAppendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n4. Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a\nFor the validity of Istisna\u2019a, the following rules should be fulfilled:\n4/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019\n4/1/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019 must be known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its:\na) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.;\nb) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.;\nc) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications; and\nd) Quantity.\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\nAppendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n4. Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a\nFor the validity of Istisna\u2019a, the following rules should be fulfilled:\n4/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019\n4/1/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019 must be known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its essential characteristics. For tangible assets, this includes:\na) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.;\nb) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.;\nc) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications or other relevant standards; and\nd) Quantity.\nFor intangible assets or services, specification should address the functional, technical, and performance requirements, scope, and deliverables sufficiently to define the subject matter and remove material uncertainty (Gharar). This may involve detailed descriptions of:\na) Kind/Nature of the asset or service (e.g., AI software platform, consulting service);\nb) Scope and key functionalities/features;\nc) Performance metrics, quality standards, or acceptance criteria relevant to the nature of the intangible asset or service; and\nd) Defined deliverables or measurable outcomes.\nThe level of detail required for specification should be proportionate to the nature and complexity of Al-Masnoo\u2019, ensuring clarity for both parties regarding the agreed-upon subject matter.\n\n## Rationale\nThis enhancement retains the existing guidance for tangible assets while adding specific, relevant criteria for specifying intangible assets and services. It acknowledges that \"Quality\" and \"Quantity\" for software or services are defined differently than for physical goods (e.g., performance metrics, deliverables vs. physical dimensions or material grades). By focusing on functional, technical, and performance requirements, scope, and deliverables, it provides a practical framework for applying the specification condition to contracts like software development, reducing ambiguity and aligning the standard with the realities of such projects while still upholding the Shari'a requirement to mitigate Gharar.\n\n```\n\n```\n# Proposal 3: Refine R&D Cost Treatment for Intangible Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe standard explicitly excludes \"research and development costs\" from Istisna'a contract costs. In the context of large-scale, bespoke AI software development, significant R&D might be integral to creating the specific asset for the client, rather than being general overhead or exploratory R&D. Excluding these direct R&D costs from the project cost distorts the true cost of the contract and affects profitability measurement and asset valuation under the standard.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nStatement of the Standard\n2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)\n2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs\na) Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and admin-istrative expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs. (para. 2)\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\nStatement of the Standard\n2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)\n2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs\na) Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs of producing, developing, or constructing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and admin-istrative expenses and selling expenses shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs. Research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs, UNLESS such costs are directly attributable to the design, development, and production of the specific Al-Masnoo\u2019 subject to the Istisna\u2019a contract, particularly in the case of bespoke or innovative intangible assets or services. (para. 2)\n\n## Rationale\nThis modification creates a necessary exception to the general exclusion of R&D costs. It allows R&D costs that are directly and specifically incurred for the creation of the contracted Al-Masnoo' (especially relevant for bespoke intangible assets like AI software) to be included in the contract costs. This ensures that the recognized cost of the Istisna'a contract accurately reflects the economic resources consumed in creating the specific asset for the client, leading to more accurate profit recognition and asset valuation, and better alignment with the substance of contracts involving significant development effort. General or exploratory R&D not specific to a contract remains excluded.\n\n```\n\n```\n# Proposal 4: Provide Measurement Guidance for Intangible Work-in-Progress\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe concepts of \"Istisna'a work-in-progress\" and its measurement at \"cash equivalent value\" are primarily framed for tangible assets. Applying these concepts to intangible assets like software development, where the \"progress\" is intangible code and knowledge, and the \"cash equivalent value\" of partially completed bespoke software is highly subjective or non-existent, creates significant measurement challenges and potential for inconsistent application.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nStatement of the Standard\n2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)\n2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs\nb) Istisna\u2019a costs incurred during a financial period, as well as pre-contract costs as described in (c) below, shall be recognized in an Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress account, and reported under assets in the statement of financial position of the Islamic bank. (In case of parallel Istisna\u2019a, this account shall be called Istisna\u2019a costs account as stated in 2/2 a). Amounts billed to Al-Mustasni\u2019 will be debited to Istisna\u2019a accounts receivable account and credited to an Istisna\u2019a billings account.\n2/4 Measurement of Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress, Istisna\u2019a costs and treat-ment of contract losses at the end of a financial period\na) In the event of applying the percentage of completion method for the recognition of Istisna\u2019a revenue and profit, Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress shall be measured and reported in the statement of financial position of the Islamic bank at a value not exceeding its cash equivalent value (i.e., the difference between the contract price and the expected additional cost to complete the contract). (para. 19)\n\nAppendix (F) Definitions\nIstisna\u2019a Work-in-Progress Account\nThis is an asset account in which the Istisna\u2019a contract costs are accu-mulated. When the percentage-of-completion method is used, a portion of Istisna\u2019a profit commensurate with the work completed during a financial period is also debited to this account.\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\nStatement of the Standard\n2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)\n2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs\nb) Istisna\u2019a costs incurred during a financial period, as well as pre-contract costs as described in (c) below, shall be recognized in an Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress account, and reported under assets in the statement of financial position of the Islamic bank. This applies to Istisna'a contracts for tangible assets, intangible assets, or services. (In case of parallel Istisna\u2019a, this account shall be called Istisna\u2019a costs account as stated in 2/2 a). Amounts billed to Al-Mustasni\u2019 will be debited to Istisna\u2019a accounts receivable account and credited to an Istisna\u2019a billings account.\n2/4 Measurement of Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress, Istisna\u2019a costs and treat-ment of contract losses at the end of a financial period\na) In the event of applying the percentage of completion method for the recognition of Istisna\u2019a revenue and profit, Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress shall be measured and reported in the statement of financial position of the Islamic bank at a value not exceeding its recoverable amount. For tangible assets, the recoverable amount is the lower of its cost or cash equivalent value (i.e., the difference between the contract price and the expected additional cost to complete the contract). For intangible assets or services, the recoverable amount is generally the lower of its accumulated cost plus recognized profit, or the portion of the contract price attributable to the work completed less costs to complete and fulfil. An assessment of whether the contract is expected to be profitable upon completion is necessary to determine if the accumulated work-in-progress value exceeds the recoverable amount. (para. 19)\n\nAppendix (F) Definitions\nIstisna\u2019a Work-in-Progress Account\nThis is an asset account in which the Istisna\u2019a contract costs are accu-mulated for the development or manufacture of Al-Masnoo' (tangible or intangible assets, or services). When the percentage-of-completion method is used, a portion of Istisna\u2019a profit commensurate with the work completed during a financial period is also debited to this account.\n\n## Rationale\nThis enhancement clarifies that the WIP concept applies to intangible assets and services. More importantly, it introduces the concept of \"recoverable amount\" as the measurement ceiling, providing specific guidance for intangible assets that differs from the tangible \"cash equivalent value\" based on selling a partially completed physical item. For intangibles, the recoverable amount is linked to the contract's expected profitability and the value derived from completing the specific contract, which is a more appropriate measure than a hypothetical market value for unfinished bespoke software. This provides a clearer and more applicable measurement basis for intangible Istisna'a projects.\n\n```\n\n```\n# Proposal 5: Address Phased or Milestone-Based Delivery\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe discussion on delivery dates in the Juristic Rules section is framed around \"fixing a date for delivering Al-Masnoo',\" which implies a single delivery event. Complex intangible projects like software development often involve phased delivery of modules, iterative releases, or continuous deployment rather than a single, final handover. This section needs to clarify how such phased delivery structures fit within the Istisna'a framework.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nAppendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n4. Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a\n4/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019\n4/1/3 Fixing a date for delivering Al-Masnoo\u2019\nThere are three opinions in the Hanafis School relating to fixing a date for delivering Al-Masnoo\u2019.\na) Imam Abu Hanifa prevented fixing any future date for the delivery of Al-Masnoo\u2019. If a date is fixed, then the contract turns into Salam because this is a characteristic of a binding contract is being executed shall be recognized as revenue for that period. (para. 8)\n\n(The excerpt provided ends abruptly here, but the context is clearly about the implications of fixing a delivery date on the contract's nature and validity).\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\nAppendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n4. Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a\n4/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019\n4/1/3 Fixing a date or timeline for delivering Al-Masnoo\u2019\nThere are three opinions in the Hanafis School relating to fixing a date for delivering Al-Masnoo\u2019.\na) Imam Abu Hanifa prevented fixing any future date for the delivery of Al-Masnoo\u2019. If a date is fixed, then the contract turns into Salam because this is a characteristic of a binding contract is being executed shall be recognized as revenue for that period. (para. 8)\nb) The other two opinions permit fixing a delivery date, considering it a condition for the benefit of Al-Mustasni' or permissible based on Istihsan and the common practice where such contracts require timelines.\nc) For intangible assets or services, delivery may occur in phases or against defined milestones over a period, rather than as a single, completed item at a fixed future date. Specifying a timeline, schedule, or milestone delivery plan for such projects is permissible and helps define the contract terms, aligning with the need to remove Gharar. The accounting recognition should correspond to the progress towards completion of the overall contract, regardless of the specific delivery schedule of intermediate phases or milestones, unless the contract specifies otherwise.\n\n## Rationale\nThis addition clarifies that phased or milestone-based delivery, common in software development and service contracts, is permissible within the Istisna'a framework. It acknowledges the practical nature of such projects and confirms that specifying a timeline or delivery plan, even if phased, is acceptable and beneficial for clarity. This addresses the implicit focus on single-point delivery in the original text and provides guidance relevant to modern intangible projects.\n\n```",
    "validation": "Okay, Standards Validator Agent reporting for duty. I will evaluate each proposed enhancement to AAOIFI FAS 10 against the specified criteria.\n\n---\n\n**Validation Report: Proposed Enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10**\n\n**Overall Context:** The proposals aim to clarify and adapt AAOIFI FAS 10 to better accommodate contracts for intangible assets and services, specifically using the example of large-scale AI software development.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 1: Clarify Subject Matter Scope for Intangible Assets and Services**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Modify the definition of Istisna'a in Appendix (C) and Appendix (F) to explicitly include \"developed, constructed\" alongside \"manufactured\" and state that Al-Masnoo' can be \"a tangible asset, an intangible asset, a service, or a combination thereof\". Also changes \"raw material or labour\" to \"raw material/inputs or labour/effort\".\n*   **Original Text Reference:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules 2. Definition; Appendix (F) Definitions - Istisna'a. Note (7) in Appendix (C) is also relevant.\n\n*   **Validation Check:**\n\n    1.  **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* Istisna'a is legitimized by Shariah primarily through Istihsan (juristic preference) and Maslaha (public interest/need), and by analogy (Qiyas) to Salam, accounting for the non-existence of the subject matter at contract inception by its clear specification and future delivery. The core Shariah principle to address is Gharar (excessive uncertainty) regarding the subject matter. Expanding the scope to include intangible assets and services is consistent with the *spirit* of Istisna'a, which is fundamentally a contract for something *made-to-order* according to specifications, irrespective of whether it's a physical item, a piece of software, or a defined service outcome. The existing standard already implicitly acknowledges services in footnote (7), suggesting the juristic basis allows for this. Explicitly including \"developed\" and \"constructed\" reflects the nature of creating intangible assets or complex projects, which is analogous to manufacturing. The terms \"inputs\" and \"effort\" provide a more suitable description of the resources contributed by the Sani' in non-manufacturing contexts (like software development or service provision) compared to solely \"raw material\" and \"labour\". This clarification reduces ambiguity (a form of Gharar) about the standard's applicability to modern contract types. It does not introduce Riba, Maysir, or conflict with asset-backing (as intangible assets are recognized assets in modern finance), risk-sharing (Istisna'a is a fixed-price sale contract, risk is on the Sani' until delivery), ethics, or transparency.\n        *   *Compliance:* Complies.\n\n    2.  **Consistency Check (FAS 10 Internal):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* The proposal brings the main definition text into explicit alignment with footnote (7) which already mentions that the subject matter \"may be a commodity, service or both\". This enhances internal consistency by removing the subtle discrepancy between the core definition's language and the footnote. It sets the stage for subsequent necessary adaptations in specification, measurement, and delivery terms, which the other proposals address. Without this foundational clarification in the definition, applying other rules to intangibles would be inconsistent with the stated scope.\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent.\n\n    3.  **Consistency Check (Other Related Standards):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* Other AAOIFI standards, such as FAS 4 (Musharaka), already acknowledge intangible assets in the context of capital contributions, demonstrating that AAOIFI recognizes intangible assets as valid subject matter in financial transactions. Applying Istisna'a to intangible assets like software is distinct from Salam (FAS 7) which is for fungible, specified commodities (Dhayn), whereas Istisna'a is for bespoke, manufactured/developed items (Ayn). This proposal maintains that distinction while expanding the scope of Istisna'a appropriately.\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent.\n\n    4.  **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This clarification is highly practical and necessary for Islamic financial institutions to structure and account for financing of modern projects involving software development, consulting services, and other intangible creations using the Istisna'a model. It removes a significant barrier of ambiguity.\n        *   *Practicality:* Practical and necessary.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED**\n    *   *Detailed Feedback:* This proposal is foundational and essential for adapting FAS 10 to the realities of modern business and technology. It aligns the standard's explicit language with the implicit scope already suggested by footnote (7) and the general permissibility of Istisna'a based on Maslaha. It introduces appropriate terminology (\"developed\", \"constructed\", \"inputs\", \"effort\") that resonates with intangible asset creation. It is Shariah-compliant and crucial for practical application.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 2: Adapt Specification Requirements for Intangible Assets and Services**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Modify section 4/1/1 in Appendix (C) to retain the Kind, Type, Quality, Quantity requirements for tangible assets, but add specific guidance for intangible assets/services, focusing on functional, technical, and performance requirements, scope, and deliverables, explicitly linking this to removing Gharar.\n*   **Original Text Reference:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules 4/1/1.\n\n*   **Validation Check:**\n\n    1.  **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* The fundamental Shariah requirement addressed by 4/1/1 is the removal of Gharar regarding the subject matter (Al-Masnoo'). The original criteria (Kind, Type, Quality, Quantity) are the *means* to achieve this for tangible goods. The proposal correctly identifies that these specific means are not universally applicable to intangibles like software. It proposes *alternative means* (functional specs, scope, deliverables, performance metrics) that achieve the *same Shariah objective* \u2013 ensuring the subject matter is known and specified sufficiently to remove material uncertainty for both parties. This is a valid adaptation of the principle to a different context and fully complies with the prohibition of Gharar.\n        *   *Compliance:* Complies.\n\n    2.  **Consistency Check (FAS 10 Internal):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This proposal directly supports Proposal 1 by detailing *how* the specified intangible assets or services (now explicitly included in the definition) must be defined to satisfy the existing requirement for Al-Masnoo' to be \"known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge\". It adds necessary detail without contradicting the core requirement or the existing guidance for tangible assets. It enhances the usability and clarity of the standard for a broader range of contracts.\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent.\n\n    3.  **Consistency Check (Other Related Standards):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* The requirement for clear specification of the subject matter is a fundamental principle across various Islamic finance contracts (e.g., Salam requires precise specification of the Muslam Fihi). This proposal upholds this principle for Istisna'a while providing practical guidance tailored to intangible assets, ensuring consistency in the underlying principle across standards, even if the method of specification differs by contract type.\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent.\n\n    4.  **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This adaptation is crucial for practical implementation in contracts for software development, IT services, and other intangible outputs. Standard industry practice for such projects involves detailed Statements of Work (SOWs) that define scope, functionality, technical requirements, performance criteria, and deliverables. The proposed wording aligns perfectly with this practice, making it feasible to structure and validate such contracts under FAS 10.\n        *   *Practicality:* Highly practical and essential.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED**\n    *   *Detailed Feedback:* This proposal provides the necessary practical framework for applying the essential Shariah requirement of clear subject matter specification (removal of Gharar) to intangible assets and services. It correctly identifies that the *method* of specification must adapt to the nature of the asset, while the underlying *principle* remains the same. It is Shariah-compliant, internally consistent, and vital for the practical application of FAS 10 to modern contracts.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 3: Refine R&D Cost Treatment for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Modify section 2/1(a) to add an exception to the exclusion of research and development costs, allowing inclusion if such costs are \"directly attributable to the design, development, and production of the specific Al-Masnoo\u2019 subject to the Istisna\u2019a contract, particularly in the case of bespoke or innovative intangible assets or services\".\n*   **Original Text Reference:** Statement of the Standard 2/1(a).\n\n*   **Validation Check:**\n\n    1.  **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This proposal primarily concerns the accounting treatment of costs, which relates to the Shariah principles of Transparency and accurate determination of profit/loss (relevant even in a fixed-price contract like Istisna'a for the Sani's internal reporting and financial position). The original exclusion of R&D costs likely stems from the idea that R&D is often a general operating expense or exploratory activity not tied to a specific, revenue-generating contract. However, in the context of a bespoke, made-to-order intangible asset like a complex AI platform, a significant portion of the R&D effort might be specific to fulfilling that particular contract's unique requirements. Including these *directly attributable* costs in the contract's cost base accurately reflects the economic resources consumed in creating the specific asset for the client. Excluding them would lead to an understatement of the contract's true cost and potentially misrepresent profitability. This proposal aligns the accounting treatment with the economic substance of the transaction, which is consistent with the need for accurate and transparent financial reporting under Shariah. It does not introduce Riba, Gharar, or Maysir.\n        *   *Compliance:* Complies.\n\n    2.  **Consistency Check (FAS 10 Internal):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This creates a specific exception to the general rule in 2/1(a). It is necessary to accommodate the nature of development costs for intangible assets, as recognized in Proposal 1 and 2. This modification supports the overall goal of applying FAS 10 to intangibles by ensuring the reported costs accurately reflect the effort involved. It needs to be read in conjunction with the profit recognition rules (e.g., percentage of completion in 2/4(a)), as accurate cost determination is fundamental to reliable profit recognition under that method. The proposed wording limits the exception to costs directly attributable to the *specific* contract, which maintains consistency with the contract-centric nature of Istisna'a accounting.\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent, provided it's applied carefully to distinguish direct contract costs from general R&D.\n\n    3.  **Consistency Check (Other Related Standards):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* While AAOIFI standards don't strictly follow conventional accounting principles, the concept of capitalizing costs directly attributable to creating an asset or fulfilling a specific contract is a widely accepted accounting principle (e.g., in IFRS/GAAP for internally developed intangible assets or long-term contracts). This proposal moves towards alignment with sound accounting practices where they do not conflict with Shariah, enhancing the standard's credibility and comparability without introducing Shariah issues.\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent with general accounting principles regarding specific project costs.\n\n    4.  **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This is highly practical for institutions undertaking bespoke software development or similar projects. The cost of such projects often includes significant effort in design, algorithm development, testing, etc., specific to the client's needs. Excluding these would make the standard impractical for accurately reflecting the financial performance of such contracts. The challenge lies in clearly defining and tracking which R&D costs are *directly attributable* versus general or exploratory, but this is a standard accounting challenge, not specific to Islamic finance or this proposal.\n        *   *Practicality:* Practical and necessary.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED**\n    *   *Detailed Feedback:* This proposal provides a necessary and logical exception to the general exclusion of R&D costs, acknowledging that for bespoke intangible assets created under an Istisna'a contract, specific development costs are integral to the production process. It aligns the accounting treatment with the economic reality of creating such assets for a client, supporting accurate cost and profit recognition. It is Shariah-compliant and essential for the practical application of FAS 10 to intangible projects.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 4: Provide Measurement Guidance for Intangible Work-in-Progress**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Modify section 2/1(b) and 2/4(a), and Appendix (F) definition of WIP. Clarify that WIP applies to intangibles/services. Introduce \"recoverable amount\" as the measurement ceiling in 2/4(a). Define recoverable amount differently for tangibles (lower of cost or cash equivalent) and intangibles/services (lower of accumulated cost + recognized profit, or portion of contract price for work completed less costs to complete/fulfil), linking it to contract profitability.\n*   **Original Text Reference:** Statement of the Standard 2/1(b), 2/4(a); Appendix (F) Definitions - Istisna\u2019a Work-in-Progress Account.\n\n*   **Validation Check:**\n\n    1.  **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This proposal deals with asset measurement and loss recognition, which relates to the Shariah principles of Transparency, Fairness, and prudent financial reporting. The original \"cash equivalent value\" for tangible WIP makes sense as a potential market value for a partially completed physical item. For bespoke intangible assets like software, there is typically no independent market value for partially completed work; its value is entirely derived from the specific contract with the client. Measuring WIP at accumulated cost plus recognized profit (when using percentage of completion) is standard practice, but the ceiling should reflect its ultimate realizable value from the contract. The concept of \"recoverable amount\" based on the contract's expected profitability and the portion of the contract price attributable to completed work is a sound accounting principle that ensures the asset (WIP) is not valued above what can be recovered from the contract. This method facilitates the timely recognition of anticipated losses (as required by 2/4(b)), which is a prudent approach consistent with Shariah's emphasis on avoiding deception and ensuring fairness in financial reporting. It does not introduce Riba, Gharar, or Maysir.\n        *   *Compliance:* Complies.\n\n    2.  **Consistency Check (FAS 10 Internal):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This proposal provides a necessary adaptation of the WIP measurement principle (2/4(a)) to the asset types introduced in Proposal 1. It clarifies that the WIP concept (2/1(b)) applies broadly. The new definition of \"recoverable amount\" for intangibles is consistent with the percentage of completion method, where profit is recognized based on progress towards completing the *contract*, and the accumulated WIP value includes costs and recognized profit. The link to assessing contract profitability aligns with the existing requirement in 2/4(b) to recognize expected losses. It provides a practical and conceptually sound method for valuing WIP of intangible assets within the existing structure of the standard.\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent.\n\n    3.  **Consistency Check (Other Related Standards):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* The concept of measuring assets at a recoverable amount or recognizing impairment when the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount is a standard accounting principle applied across various asset types and transactions (e.g., in FAS 4 Musharaka where non-monetary capital is measured at fair value). Applying this principle to Istisna'a WIP for intangibles, tailored to the contract-specific nature of their value, aligns with this broader accounting concept in a Shariah-compliant manner.\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent with broader accounting principles.\n\n    4.  **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This is essential for practical implementation. Without specific guidance, valuing intangible WIP under the original \"cash equivalent value\" rule would be problematic or impossible. The proposed \"recoverable amount\" framework provides a workable and appropriate measurement basis for projects where the value of the work-in-progress is intrinsically tied to the specific contract's completion and profitability. It guides institutions on how to apply the percentage of completion method reliably to intangible projects.\n        *   *Practicality:* Highly practical and essential.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED**\n    *   *Detailed Feedback:* This proposal provides crucial and practical guidance for measuring work-in-progress for intangible assets under FAS 10. It correctly identifies the limitations of the \"cash equivalent value\" concept for bespoke intangibles and introduces a \"recoverable amount\" framework that is both sound from an accounting perspective and consistent with Shariah principles requiring prudent valuation and loss recognition.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 5: Address Phased or Milestone-Based Delivery**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Add a new point 4/1/3(c) in Appendix (C) to clarify that phased or milestone-based delivery is permissible for intangible assets/services and that specifying such a timeline/plan is acceptable and helps remove Gharar. Also notes accounting recognition should align with overall progress.\n*   **Original Text Reference:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules 4/1/3.\n\n*   **Validation Check:**\n\n    1.  **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* The original section 4/1/3 discusses the juristic debate among Hanafis regarding *fixing a date* for delivery, primarily due to the concern it might resemble Salam (which requires upfront payment). However, the standard acknowledges the permissibility of fixing a date based on Istihsan/Maslaha (opinions b and c in the original text, though only 'a' is fully quoted in the prompt, the context implies the others are the basis for the standard's allowance). Phased or milestone delivery, common in complex modern projects, is a practical method of defining the *process* and *timeline* of delivering the overall subject matter. As long as the total subject matter is clearly specified (as addressed in Proposal 2) and the phased delivery plan is agreed upon, this structure helps *remove* Gharar regarding the delivery process and timeline, rather than introducing it. It's a practical application of the permissible view on specifying delivery terms to the nature of intangible projects. It doesn't affect the fixed price or introduce Riba or Maysir.\n        *   *Compliance:* Complies, consistent with the broader juristic basis of Istisna'a and the need to remove Gharar.\n\n    2.  **Consistency Check (FAS 10 Internal):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This proposal adds a point under the existing section on delivery dates (4/1/3). It doesn't contradict the historical juristic debate but clarifies how the outcome of that debate (permissibility of specifying delivery terms) applies to the specific nature of intangible projects. It aligns the juristic rules with the practical realities of modern contracts and supports the accounting approach (percentage of completion) which is based on progress over time, not necessarily a single delivery event. The note about accounting recognition reinforces consistency with the standard's existing accounting treatment for revenue and profit recognition based on progress (para. 2/3/2, 2/4(a)).\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent.\n\n    3.  **Consistency Check (Other Related Standards):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* While other standards might focus on single asset delivery (like Murabaha FAS 28) or fungible goods delivery (Salam FAS 7), Istisna'a inherently deals with the creation process over time. Accommodating phased delivery for complex, made-to-order items aligns with the nature of the Istisna'a contract itself and the need for flexibility in structuring such projects.\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent with the nature of Istisna'a.\n\n    4.  **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* Phased or milestone delivery is standard practice in large software development and service projects. Explicitly permitting this structure within the Istisna'a framework is essential for the standard to be practical and applicable to such contracts. It provides necessary clarity for both parties and auditors.\n        *   *Practicality:* Highly practical and essential.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED**\n    *   *Detailed Feedback:* This proposal provides necessary clarification on delivery terms for intangible assets and services, aligning the standard with modern contractual practices while remaining consistent with the underlying Shariah basis of Istisna'a. It addresses a practical ambiguity created by the original text's focus on single-point delivery.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nAll four proposed enhancements are well-reasoned, interconnected, and necessary to effectively apply AAOIFI FAS 10 to contracts involving intangible assets and services like large-scale software development. They collectively address the key challenges related to scope, specification, cost recognition, measurement, and delivery for such projects, while remaining compliant with core Shariah principles and consistent with the overall structure and intent of FAS 10. They provide practical guidance that aligns the standard with the realities of the modern economy.\n\nTherefore, all proposals are recommended for **APPROVAL**.\n\n---\n**Validation Agent Stamp:**\n\n[Seal of Standards Validator Agent]\nDate: [Current Date]",

Definition, and Appendix (F) Definitions, \"Istisna'a\" definition.\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The primary definition of Istisna'a refers to Al-Sani' undertaking \"to have manufactured or otherwise acquire Al-Masnoo'\". While Note (7) explicitly states, \"The subject matter may be a commodity, service or both,\" the core definition and the subsequent detailed conditions and accounting treatments heavily lean towards tangible manufacturing or construction. The term \"manufactured\" does not intuitively apply to the development of intangible software.\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** The scenario involves developing an AI software platform, which is primarily an intangible asset and a complex service involving design, coding, training, and integration. The standard's language, rooted in manufacturing and tangible goods, creates ambiguity about whether software development genuinely fits the \"manufactured or otherwise acquire\" criteria, despite the note about services. This foundational ambiguity affects the confidence in applying the entire standard to such a project.\n\n**2. Specific Section/Clause:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a, Section 4. Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a, specifically 4/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019 and its sub-points 4/1/1 (a, b, c, d).\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** Section 4/1/1 requires Al-Masnoo' to be \"known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its: a) Kind, b) Type, c) Quality, and d) Quantity.\" It gives examples like \"car, airoplane or house\" and specifying \"Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications\". This language is highly specific to tangible, physical goods.\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** Defining the \"Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity\" of a large-scale, complex AI software platform upfront with the same level of precision as a physical object is exceptionally difficult.\n    *   **Kind/Type:** While \"AI Software Platform\" is a kind, specifying the exact \"type\" and its sub-components (modules, algorithms) in detail upfront is challenging.\n    *   **Quality:** Defining \"Quality\" for AI software is complex. It involves not just functionality but performance, accuracy (which can change based on data), scalability, security, usability, etc. Relying on \"established tables of specifications\" is problematic as bespoke software, especially cutting-edge AI, often lacks such pre-defined, exhaustive tables. Specifications often evolve during development.\n    *   **Quantity:** \"Quantity\" for software is ambiguous. Is it lines of code, number of features, number of users supported, processing capacity? This metric needs clarification for intangible assets.\n    The requirement for such precise upfront specification, while crucial for mitigating *Gharar* (uncertainty) in tangible sales, poses a significant hurdle for the dynamic and often iterative nature of large software development projects, leading to uncertainty in contract validity from a Shari'a perspective based on this standard's conditions.\n\n**3. Specific Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, Section 2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller), specifically 2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs, point (a).\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** This clause states that Istisna'a costs consist of \"(I) Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo'; and (II) Indirect costs... General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, **research and development costs shall not be included** in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs.\"\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** Large-scale AI software development often involves significant research and development efforts, especially if it's innovative or tailored to a specific, complex problem. Excluding \"research and development costs\" from the project's recognized Istisna'a costs creates a mismatch between the actual economic cost of developing the AI platform and the cost recognized under the standard. This could lead to an inaccurate representation of the project's profitability and asset value, particularly given that R&D is an integral part of creating such an asset, not merely a general corporate overhead.\n\n**4.

It also requires measuring this work-in-progress \"at a value not exceeding its cash equivalent value (i.e., the difference between the contract price and the expected additional cost to complete the contract)\" (2/4(a)). The definition of the WIP account refers to accumulated costs and recognized profit.\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** The concept of \"work-in-progress\" and its \"cash equivalent value\" is straightforward for tangible assets (e.g., raw materials, partial construction). For intangible software development, measuring the \"work-in-progress\" as a balance sheet asset is less intuitive. How is the value of partially completed code, algorithms, or training data accurately determined? Furthermore, the \"cash equivalent value\" of partially completed *bespoke* AI software, which might have little to no alternative market use until fully completed, is highly subjective and difficult to assess reliably. This poses significant measurement challenges.\n\n**5. Specific Section/Clause:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules, Section 4. Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a, specifically 4/1/3 Fixing a date for delivering Al-Masnoo\u2019.\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The section discusses opinions on fixing a delivery date, noting that fixing a date might turn the contract into Salam according to some views, but other views permit it.\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** Large-scale software development, especially AI, often involves phased delivery, continuous integration, and ongoing updates rather than a single, fixed delivery event for the entire \"Al-Masnoo'\". The standard's discussion feels more aligned with the one-off delivery of a finished physical product. While fixing milestones is common in software, the concept of a single, final \"delivery date\" for a complex, evolving platform might not fit neatly, potentially causing structural or contractual issues under this clause.\n\n**6. Potential Inconsistency:** The allowance for \"service\" as a subject matter in Note (7) of Appendix C seems inconsistent with the detailed conditions for specifying Al-Masnoo' (4/1/1) and the accounting treatments (2/1, 2/4) which are predominantly framed around tangible goods and manufacturing/construction concepts.\n\nIn summary, while FAS 10 provides a framework for Istisna'a, its language, examples, and specific requirements (especially regarding subject matter specification, cost components like R&D, and WIP measurement/valuation) are heavily rooted in tangible asset production. Applying this standard directly to the complex, dynamic, and intangible nature of large-scale AI software development presents significant challenges and ambiguities that the current wording does not fully address. Enhancement would involve providing specific guidance, examples, and potentially adapted criteria for intangible assets and service-based Istisna'a."

It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide either the raw material or the labour.\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\nAppendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n2. Definition\nIstisna\u2019a is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller), whereby Al-Sani\u2019- based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured, developed, constructed or otherwise acquired Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract, which may be a tangible asset, an intangible asset, a service, or a combination thereof) according to the specifications and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be in advance, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time. It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide either the raw material/inputs or the labour/effort required.\n\nAppendix (F) Definitions\nIstisna\u2019a\nIt is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 , (the seller) whereby Al-Sani\u2019 - based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured, developed, constructed or otherwise acquire Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract, which may be a tangible asset, an intangible asset, a service, or a combination thereof) according to the specifications and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be at the time of contracting, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time. It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide either the raw material/inputs or the labour/effort required.\n\n## Rationale\nThis change explicitly incorporates the terms \"developed\" and \"constructed\" alongside \"manufactured\" and clarifies that Al-Masnoo' can be a tangible asset, an intangible asset, a service, or a combination. This directly addresses the ambiguity regarding the application of Istisna'a to intangible assets like software development. By making this explicit in the core definition, it provides a clear foundation for applying the standard to a wider range of modern contracts, including those for complex software platforms, and aligns the main definition with the concept mentioned in footnote (7) but integrates it more effectively into the standard's primary text. The terms \"inputs\" and \"effort\" are added to provide parallel concepts to \"raw material\" and \"labour\" suitable for non-manufacturing contexts.\n\n```\n\n```\n# Proposal 2: Adapt Specification Requirements for Intangible Assets and Services\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe conditions for the validity of Istisna'a require Al-Masnoo' to be specified in terms of Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity, with examples and language tailored for tangible goods (\"car, airoplane, house\", \"established tables of specifications\").

For tangible assets, this includes:\na) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.;\nb) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.;\nc) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications or other relevant standards; and\nd) Quantity.\nFor intangible assets or services, specification should address the functional, technical, and performance requirements, scope, and deliverables sufficiently to define the subject matter and remove material uncertainty (Gharar). This may involve detailed descriptions of:\na) Kind/Nature of the asset or service (e.g., AI software platform, consulting service);\nb) Scope and key functionalities/features;\nc) Performance metrics, quality standards, or acceptance criteria relevant to the nature of the intangible asset or service; and\nd) Defined deliverables or measurable outcomes.\nThe level of detail required for specification should be proportionate to the nature and complexity of Al-Masnoo\u2019, ensuring clarity for both parties regarding the agreed-upon subject matter.\n\n## Rationale\nThis enhancement retains the existing guidance for tangible assets while adding specific, relevant criteria for specifying intangible assets and services. It acknowledges that \"Quality\" and \"Quantity\" for software or services are defined differently than for physical goods (e.g., performance metrics, deliverables vs. physical dimensions or material grades). By focusing on functional, technical, and performance requirements, scope, and deliverables, it provides a practical framework for applying the specification condition to contracts like software development, reducing ambiguity and aligning the standard with the realities of such projects while still upholding the Shari'a requirement to mitigate Gharar.\n\n```\n\n```\n# Proposal 3: Refine R&D Cost Treatment for Intangible Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe standard explicitly excludes \"research and development costs\" from Istisna'a contract costs. In the context of large-scale, bespoke AI software development, significant R&D might be integral to creating the specific asset for the client, rather than being general overhead or exploratory R&D. Excluding these direct R&D costs from the project cost distorts the true cost of the contract and affects profitability measurement and asset valuation under the standard.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nStatement of the Standard\n2.

General and admin-istrative expenses and selling expenses shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs. Research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs, UNLESS such costs are directly attributable to the design, development, and production of the specific Al-Masnoo\u2019 subject to the Istisna\u2019a contract, particularly in the case of bespoke or innovative intangible assets or services. (para. 2)\n\n## Rationale\nThis modification creates a necessary exception to the general exclusion of R&D costs. It allows R&D costs that are directly and specifically incurred for the creation of the contracted Al-Masnoo' (especially relevant for bespoke intangible assets like AI software) to be included in the contract costs. This ensures that the recognized cost of the Istisna'a contract accurately reflects the economic resources consumed in creating the specific asset for the client, leading to more accurate profit recognition and asset valuation, and better alignment with the substance of contracts involving significant development effort. General or exploratory R&D not specific to a contract remains excluded.\n\n```\n\n```\n# Proposal 4: Provide Measurement Guidance for Intangible Work-in-Progress\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe concepts of \"Istisna'a work-in-progress\" and its measurement at \"cash equivalent value\" are primarily framed for tangible assets. Applying these concepts to intangible assets like software development, where the \"progress\" is intangible code and knowledge, and the \"cash equivalent value\" of partially completed bespoke software is highly subjective or non-existent, creates significant measurement challenges and potential for inconsistent application.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nStatement of the Standard\n2.

For tangible assets, the recoverable amount is the lower of its cost or cash equivalent value (i.e., the difference between the contract price and the expected additional cost to complete the contract). For intangible assets or services, the recoverable amount is generally the lower of its accumulated cost plus recognized profit, or the portion of the contract price attributable to the work completed less costs to complete and fulfil. An assessment of whether the contract is expected to be profitable upon completion is necessary to determine if the accumulated work-in-progress value exceeds the recoverable amount. (para. 19)\n\nAppendix (F) Definitions\nIstisna\u2019a Work-in-Progress Account\nThis is an asset account in which the Istisna\u2019a contract costs are accu-mulated for the development or manufacture of Al-Masnoo' (tangible or intangible assets, or services). When the percentage-of-completion method is used, a portion of Istisna\u2019a profit commensurate with the work completed during a financial period is also debited to this account.\n\n## Rationale\nThis enhancement clarifies that the WIP concept applies to intangible assets and services. More importantly, it introduces the concept of \"recoverable amount\" as the measurement ceiling, providing specific guidance for intangible assets that differs from the tangible \"cash equivalent value\" based on selling a partially completed physical item. For intangibles, the recoverable amount is linked to the contract's expected profitability and the value derived from completing the specific contract, which is a more appropriate measure than a hypothetical market value for unfinished bespoke software. This provides a clearer and more applicable measurement basis for intangible Istisna'a projects.\n\n```\n\n```\n# Proposal 5: Address Phased or Milestone-Based Delivery\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe discussion on delivery dates in the Juristic Rules section is framed around \"fixing a date for delivering Al-Masnoo',\" which implies a single delivery event. Complex intangible projects like software development often involve phased delivery of modules, iterative releases, or continuous deployment rather than a single, final handover. This section needs to clarify how such phased delivery structures fit within the Istisna'a framework.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nAppendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n4.

If a date is fixed, then the contract turns into Salam because this is a characteristic of a binding contract is being executed shall be recognized as revenue for that period. (para. 8)\nb) The other two opinions permit fixing a delivery date, considering it a condition for the benefit of Al-Mustasni' or permissible based on Istihsan and the common practice where such contracts require timelines.\nc) For intangible assets or services, delivery may occur in phases or against defined milestones over a period, rather than as a single, completed item at a fixed future date. Specifying a timeline, schedule, or milestone delivery plan for such projects is permissible and helps define the contract terms, aligning with the need to remove Gharar. The accounting recognition should correspond to the progress towards completion of the overall contract, regardless of the specific delivery schedule of intermediate phases or milestones, unless the contract specifies otherwise.\n\n## Rationale\nThis addition clarifies that phased or milestone-based delivery, common in software development and service contracts, is permissible within the Istisna'a framework. It acknowledges the practical nature of such projects and confirms that specifying a timeline or delivery plan, even if phased, is acceptable and beneficial for clarity. This addresses the implicit focus on single-point delivery in the original text and provides guidance relevant to modern intangible projects.\n\n```"

It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide either the raw material/inputs or the labour/effort required.\n\n## Rationale\nThis change explicitly incorporates the terms \"developed\" and \"constructed\" alongside \"manufactured\" and clarifies that Al-Masnoo' can be a tangible asset, an intangible asset, a service, or a combination. This directly addresses the ambiguity regarding the application of Istisna'a to intangible assets like software development. By making this explicit in the core definition, it provides a clear foundation for applying the standard to a wider range of modern contracts, including those for complex software platforms, and aligns the main definition with the concept mentioned in footnote (7) but integrates it more effectively into the standard's primary text. The terms \"inputs\" and \"effort\" are added to provide parallel concepts to \"raw material\" and \"labour\" suitable for non-manufacturing contexts.\n\n```\n\n```\n# Proposal 2: Adapt Specification Requirements for Intangible Assets and Services\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe conditions for the validity of Istisna'a require Al-Masnoo' to be specified in terms of Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity, with examples and language tailored for tangible goods (\"car, airoplane, house\", \"established tables of specifications\").

Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a\n4/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019\n4/1/3 Fixing a date or timeline for delivering Al-Masnoo\u2019\nThere are three opinions in the Hanafis School relating to fixing a date for delivering Al-Masnoo\u2019.\na) Imam Abu Hanifa prevented fixing any future date for the delivery of Al-Masnoo\u2019. If a date is fixed, then the contract turns into Salam because this is a characteristic of a binding contract is being executed shall be recognized as revenue for that period. (para. 8)\nb) The other two opinions permit fixing a delivery date, considering it a condition for the benefit of Al-Mustasni' or permissible based on Istihsan and the common practice where such contracts require timelines.\nc) For intangible assets or services, delivery may occur in phases or against defined milestones over a period, rather than as a single, completed item at a fixed future date. Specifying a timeline, schedule, or milestone delivery plan for such projects is permissible and helps define the contract terms, aligning with the need to remove Gharar. The accounting recognition should correspond to the progress towards completion of the overall contract, regardless of the specific delivery schedule of intermediate phases or milestones, unless the contract specifies otherwise.\n\n## Rationale\nThis addition clarifies that phased or milestone-based delivery, common in software development and service contracts, is permissible within the Istisna'a framework. It acknowledges the practical nature of such projects and confirms that specifying a timeline or delivery plan, even if phased, is acceptable and beneficial for clarity. This addresses the implicit focus on single-point delivery in the original text and provides guidance relevant to modern intangible projects.\n\n```",
        "validation_result": "Okay, Standards Validator Agent reporting for duty. I will evaluate each proposed enhancement to AAOIFI FAS 10 against the specified criteria.\n\n---\n\n**Validation Report: Proposed Enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10**\n\n**Overall Context:** The proposals aim to clarify and adapt AAOIFI FAS 10 to better accommodate contracts for intangible assets and services, specifically using the example of large-scale AI software development.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 1: Clarify Subject Matter Scope for Intangible Assets and Services**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Modify the definition of Istisna'a in Appendix (C) and Appendix (F) to explicitly include \"developed, constructed\" alongside \"manufactured\" and state that Al-Masnoo' can be \"a tangible asset, an intangible asset, a service, or a combination thereof\". Also changes \"raw material or labour\" to \"raw material/inputs or labour/effort\".\n*   **Original Text Reference:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules 2. Definition; Appendix (F) Definitions - Istisna'a. Note (7) in Appendix (C) is also relevant.\n\n*   **Validation Check:**\n\n    1.  **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* Istisna'a is legitimized by Shariah primarily through Istihsan (juristic preference) and Maslaha (public interest/need), and by analogy (Qiyas) to Salam, accounting for the non-existence of the subject matter at contract inception by its clear specification and future delivery. The core Shariah principle to address is Gharar (excessive uncertainty) regarding the subject matter. Expanding the scope to include intangible assets and services is consistent with the *spirit* of Istisna'a, which is fundamentally a contract for something *made-to-order* according to specifications, irrespective of whether it's a physical item, a piece of software, or a defined service outcome. The existing standard already implicitly acknowledges services in footnote (7), suggesting the juristic basis allows for this. Explicitly including \"developed\" and \"constructed\" reflects the nature of creating intangible assets or complex projects, which is analogous to manufacturing. The terms \"inputs\" and \"effort\" provide a more suitable description of the resources contributed by the Sani' in non-manufacturing contexts (like software development or service provision) compared to solely \"raw material\" and \"labour\". This clarification reduces ambiguity (a form of Gharar) about the standard's applicability to modern contract types. It does not introduce Riba, Maysir, or conflict with asset-backing (as intangible assets are recognized assets in modern finance), risk-sharing (Istisna'a is a fixed-price sale contract, risk is on the Sani' until delivery), ethics, or transparency.\n        *   *Compliance:* Complies.\n\n    2.  **Consistency Check (FAS 10 Internal):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* The proposal brings the main definition text into explicit alignment with footnote (7) which already mentions that the subject matter \"may be a commodity, service or both\". This enhances internal consistency by removing the subtle discrepancy between the core definition's language and the footnote. It sets the stage for subsequent necessary adaptations in specification, measurement, and delivery terms, which the other proposals address. Without this foundational clarification in the definition, applying other rules to intangibles would be inconsistent with the stated scope.\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent.\n\n    3.  **Consistency Check (Other Related Standards):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* Other AAOIFI standards, such as FAS 4 (Musharaka), already acknowledge intangible assets in the context of capital contributions, demonstrating that AAOIFI recognizes intangible assets as valid subject matter in financial transactions. Applying Istisna'a to intangible assets like software is distinct from Salam (FAS 7) which is for fungible, specified commodities (Dhayn), whereas Istisna'a is for bespoke, manufactured/developed items (Ayn). This proposal maintains that distinction while expanding the scope of Istisna'a appropriately.\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent.\n\n    4.  **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This clarification is highly practical and necessary for Islamic financial institutions to structure and account for financing of modern projects involving software development, consulting services, and other intangible creations using the Istisna'a model. It removes a significant barrier of ambiguity.\n        *   *Practicality:* Practical and necessary.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED**\n    *   *Detailed Feedback:* This proposal is foundational and essential for adapting FAS 10 to the realities of modern business and technology. It aligns the standard's explicit language with the implicit scope already suggested by footnote (7) and the general permissibility of Istisna'a based on Maslaha. It introduces appropriate terminology (\"developed\", \"constructed\", \"inputs\", \"effort\") that resonates with intangible asset creation. It is Shariah-compliant and crucial for practical application.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 2: Adapt Specification Requirements for Intangible Assets and Services**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Modify section 4/1/1 in Appendix (C) to retain the Kind, Type, Quality, Quantity requirements for tangible assets, but add specific guidance for intangible assets/services, focusing on functional, technical, and performance requirements, scope, and deliverables, explicitly linking this to removing Gharar.\n*   **Original Text Reference:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules 4/1/1.\n\n*   **Validation Check:**\n\n    1.  **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* The fundamental Shariah requirement addressed by 4/1/1 is the removal of Gharar regarding the subject matter (Al-Masnoo'). The original criteria (Kind, Type, Quality, Quantity) are the *means* to achieve this for tangible goods. The proposal correctly identifies that these specific means are not universally applicable to intangibles like software. It proposes *alternative means* (functional specs, scope, deliverables, performance metrics) that achieve the *same Shariah objective* \u2013 ensuring the subject matter is known and specified sufficiently to remove material uncertainty for both parties. This is a valid adaptation of the principle to a different context and fully complies with the prohibition of Gharar.\n        *   *Compliance:* Complies.\n\n    2.  **Consistency Check (FAS 10 Internal):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This proposal directly supports Proposal 1 by detailing *how* the specified intangible assets or services (now explicitly included in the definition) must be defined to satisfy the existing requirement for Al-Masnoo' to be \"known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge\". It adds necessary detail without contradicting the core requirement or the existing guidance for tangible assets. It enhances the usability and clarity of the standard for a broader range of contracts.\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent.\n\n    3.  **Consistency Check (Other Related Standards):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* The requirement for clear specification of the subject matter is a fundamental principle across various Islamic finance contracts (e.g., Salam requires precise specification of the Muslam Fihi). This proposal upholds this principle for Istisna'a while providing practical guidance tailored to intangible assets, ensuring consistency in the underlying principle across standards, even if the method of specification differs by contract type.\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent.\n\n    4.  **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This adaptation is crucial for practical implementation in contracts for software development, IT services, and other intangible outputs. Standard industry practice for such projects involves detailed Statements of Work (SOWs) that define scope, functionality, technical requirements, performance criteria, and deliverables. The proposed wording aligns perfectly with this practice, making it feasible to structure and validate such contracts under FAS 10.\n        *   *Practicality:* Highly practical and essential.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED**\n    *   *Detailed Feedback:* This proposal provides the necessary practical framework for applying the essential Shariah requirement of clear subject matter specification (removal of Gharar) to intangible assets and services. It correctly identifies that the *method* of specification must adapt to the nature of the asset, while the underlying *principle* remains the same. It is Shariah-compliant, internally consistent, and vital for the practical application of FAS 10 to modern contracts.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 3: Refine R&D Cost Treatment for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Modify section 2/1(a) to add an exception to the exclusion of research and development costs, allowing inclusion if such costs are \"directly attributable to the design, development, and production of the specific Al-Masnoo\u2019 subject to the Istisna\u2019a contract, particularly in the case of bespoke or innovative intangible assets or services\".\n*   **Original Text Reference:** Statement of the Standard 2/1(a).\n\n*   **Validation Check:**\n\n    1.  **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This proposal primarily concerns the accounting treatment of costs, which relates to the Shariah principles of Transparency and accurate determination of profit/loss (relevant even in a fixed-price contract like Istisna'a for the Sani's internal reporting and financial position). The original exclusion of R&D costs likely stems from the idea that R&D is often a general operating expense or exploratory activity not tied to a specific, revenue-generating contract. However, in the context of a bespoke, made-to-order intangible asset like a complex AI platform, a significant portion of the R&D effort might be specific to fulfilling that particular contract's unique requirements. Including these *directly attributable* costs in the contract's cost base accurately reflects the economic resources consumed in creating the specific asset for the client. Excluding them would lead to an understatement of the contract's true cost and potentially misrepresent profitability. This proposal aligns the accounting treatment with the economic substance of the transaction, which is consistent with the need for accurate and transparent financial reporting under Shariah. It does not introduce Riba, Gharar, or Maysir.\n        *   *Compliance:* Complies.\n\n    2.  **Consistency Check (FAS 10 Internal):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This creates a specific exception to the general rule in 2/1(a). It is necessary to accommodate the nature of development costs for intangible assets, as recognized in Proposal 1 and 2. This modification supports the overall goal of applying FAS 10 to intangibles by ensuring the reported costs accurately reflect the effort involved. It needs to be read in conjunction with the profit recognition rules (e.g., percentage of completion in 2/4(a)), as accurate cost determination is fundamental to reliable profit recognition under that method. The proposed wording limits the exception to costs directly attributable to the *specific* contract, which maintains consistency with the contract-centric nature of Istisna'a accounting.\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent, provided it's applied carefully to distinguish direct contract costs from general R&D.\n\n    3.  **Consistency Check (Other Related Standards):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* While AAOIFI standards don't strictly follow conventional accounting principles, the concept of capitalizing costs directly attributable to creating an asset or fulfilling a specific contract is a widely accepted accounting principle (e.g., in IFRS/GAAP for internally developed intangible assets or long-term contracts). This proposal moves towards alignment with sound accounting practices where they do not conflict with Shariah, enhancing the standard's credibility and comparability without introducing Shariah issues.\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent with general accounting principles regarding specific project costs.\n\n    4.  **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This is highly practical for institutions undertaking bespoke software development or similar projects. The cost of such projects often includes significant effort in design, algorithm development, testing, etc., specific to the client's needs. Excluding these would make the standard impractical for accurately reflecting the financial performance of such contracts. The challenge lies in clearly defining and tracking which R&D costs are *directly attributable* versus general or exploratory, but this is a standard accounting challenge, not specific to Islamic finance or this proposal.\n        *   *Practicality:* Practical and necessary.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED**\n    *   *Detailed Feedback:* This proposal provides a necessary and logical exception to the general exclusion of R&D costs, acknowledging that for bespoke intangible assets created under an Istisna'a contract, specific development costs are integral to the production process. It aligns the accounting treatment with the economic reality of creating such assets for a client, supporting accurate cost and profit recognition. It is Shariah-compliant and essential for the practical application of FAS 10 to intangible projects.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 4: Provide Measurement Guidance for Intangible Work-in-Progress**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Modify section 2/1(b) and 2/4(a), and Appendix (F) definition of WIP. Clarify that WIP applies to intangibles/services. Introduce \"recoverable amount\" as the measurement ceiling in 2/4(a). Define recoverable amount differently for tangibles (lower of cost or cash equivalent) and intangibles/services (lower of accumulated cost + recognized profit, or portion of contract price for work completed less costs to complete/fulfil), linking it to contract profitability.\n*   **Original Text Reference:** Statement of the Standard 2/1(b), 2/4(a); Appendix (F) Definitions - Istisna\u2019a Work-in-Progress Account.\n\n*   **Validation Check:**\n\n    1.  **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This proposal deals with asset measurement and loss recognition, which relates to the Shariah principles of Transparency, Fairness, and prudent financial reporting. The original \"cash equivalent value\" for tangible WIP makes sense as a potential market value for a partially completed physical item. For bespoke intangible assets like software, there is typically no independent market value for partially completed work; its value is entirely derived from the specific contract with the client. Measuring WIP at accumulated cost plus recognized profit (when using percentage of completion) is standard practice, but the ceiling should reflect its ultimate realizable value from the contract. The concept of \"recoverable amount\" based on the contract's expected profitability and the portion of the contract price attributable to completed work is a sound accounting principle that ensures the asset (WIP) is not valued above what can be recovered from the contract. This method facilitates the timely recognition of anticipated losses (as required by 2/4(b)), which is a prudent approach consistent with Shariah's emphasis on avoiding deception and ensuring fairness in financial reporting. It does not introduce Riba, Gharar, or Maysir.\n        *   *Compliance:* Complies.\n\n    2.  **Consistency Check (FAS 10 Internal):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This proposal provides a necessary adaptation of the WIP measurement principle (2/4(a)) to the asset types introduced in Proposal 1. It clarifies that the WIP concept (2/1(b)) applies broadly. The new definition of \"recoverable amount\" for intangibles is consistent with the percentage of completion method, where profit is recognized based on progress towards completing the *contract*, and the accumulated WIP value includes costs and recognized profit. The link to assessing contract profitability aligns with the existing requirement in 2/4(b) to recognize expected losses. It provides a practical and conceptually sound method for valuing WIP of intangible assets within the existing structure of the standard.\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent.\n\n    3.  **Consistency Check (Other Related Standards):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* The concept of measuring assets at a recoverable amount or recognizing impairment when the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount is a standard accounting principle applied across various asset types and transactions (e.g., in FAS 4 Musharaka where non-monetary capital is measured at fair value). Applying this principle to Istisna'a WIP for intangibles, tailored to the contract-specific nature of their value, aligns with this broader accounting concept in a Shariah-compliant manner.\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent with broader accounting principles.\n\n    4.  **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This is essential for practical implementation. Without specific guidance, valuing intangible WIP under the original \"cash equivalent value\" rule would be problematic or impossible. The proposed \"recoverable amount\" framework provides a workable and appropriate measurement basis for projects where the value of the work-in-progress is intrinsically tied to the specific contract's completion and profitability. It guides institutions on how to apply the percentage of completion method reliably to intangible projects.\n        *   *Practicality:* Highly practical and essential.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED**\n    *   *Detailed Feedback:* This proposal provides crucial and practical guidance for measuring work-in-progress for intangible assets under FAS 10. It correctly identifies the limitations of the \"cash equivalent value\" concept for bespoke intangibles and introduces a \"recoverable amount\" framework that is both sound from an accounting perspective and consistent with Shariah principles requiring prudent valuation and loss recognition.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 5: Address Phased or Milestone-Based Delivery**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Add a new point 4/1/3(c) in Appendix (C) to clarify that phased or milestone-based delivery is permissible for intangible assets/services and that specifying such a timeline/plan is acceptable and helps remove Gharar. Also notes accounting recognition should align with overall progress.\n*   **Original Text Reference:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules 4/1/3.\n\n*   **Validation Check:**\n\n    1.  **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* The original section 4/1/3 discusses the juristic debate among Hanafis regarding *fixing a date* for delivery, primarily due to the concern it might resemble Salam (which requires upfront payment). However, the standard acknowledges the permissibility of fixing a date based on Istihsan/Maslaha (opinions b and c in the original text, though only 'a' is fully quoted in the prompt, the context implies the others are the basis for the standard's allowance). Phased or milestone delivery, common in complex modern projects, is a practical method of defining the *process* and *timeline* of delivering the overall subject matter. As long as the total subject matter is clearly specified (as addressed in Proposal 2) and the phased delivery plan is agreed upon, this structure helps *remove* Gharar regarding the delivery process and timeline, rather than introducing it. It's a practical application of the permissible view on specifying delivery terms to the nature of intangible projects. It doesn't affect the fixed price or introduce Riba or Maysir.\n        *   *Compliance:* Complies, consistent with the broader juristic basis of Istisna'a and the need to remove Gharar.\n\n    2.  **Consistency Check (FAS 10 Internal):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* This proposal adds a point under the existing section on delivery dates (4/1/3). It doesn't contradict the historical juristic debate but clarifies how the outcome of that debate (permissibility of specifying delivery terms) applies to the specific nature of intangible projects. It aligns the juristic rules with the practical realities of modern contracts and supports the accounting approach (percentage of completion) which is based on progress over time, not necessarily a single delivery event. The note about accounting recognition reinforces consistency with the standard's existing accounting treatment for revenue and profit recognition based on progress (para. 2/3/2, 2/4(a)).\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent.\n\n    3.  **Consistency Check (Other Related Standards):**\n        *   *Reasoning:* While other standards might focus on single asset delivery (like Murabaha FAS 28) or fungible goods delivery (Salam FAS 7), Istisna'a inherently deals with the creation process over time. Accommodating phased delivery for complex, made-to-order items aligns with the nature of the Istisna'a contract itself and the need for flexibility in structuring such projects.\n        *   *Consistency:* Consistent with the nature of Istisna'a.\n\n    4.  **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n        *   *Reasoning:* Phased or milestone delivery is standard practice in large software development and service projects. Explicitly permitting this structure within the Istisna'a framework is essential for the standard to be practical and applicable to such contracts. It provides necessary clarity for both parties and auditors.\n        *   *Practicality:* Highly practical and essential.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED**\n    *   *Detailed Feedback:* This proposal provides necessary clarification on delivery terms for intangible assets and services, aligning the standard with modern contractual practices while remaining consistent with the underlying Shariah basis of Istisna'a. It addresses a practical ambiguity created by the original text's focus on single-point delivery.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nAll four proposed enhancements are well-reasoned, interconnected, and necessary to effectively apply AAOIFI FAS 10 to contracts involving intangible assets and services like large-scale software development. They collectively address the key challenges related to scope, specification, cost recognition, measurement, and delivery for such projects, while remaining compliant with core Shariah principles and consistent with the overall structure and intent of FAS 10. They provide practical guidance that aligns the standard with the realities of the modern economy.\n\nTherefore, all proposals are recommended for **APPROVAL**.\n\n---\n**Validation Agent Stamp:**\n\n[Seal of Standards Validator Agent]\nDate: [Current Date]"

        "cross_standard_analysis": "## Cross-Standard Impact Analysis\n\nThe proposed enhancements to FAS 10 primarily aim to clarify its application to intangible assets and services by refining definitions, specification requirements, cost treatment, work-in-progress measurement, and delivery considerations. These changes are designed to make the standard more relevant and applicable to modern contracts like software development, while remaining compliant with Shari'a principles.\n\nHere's an analysis of the potential impact on other selected AAOIFI standards:\n\n1.  **FAS 4 (Musharakah and Mudarabah):**\n    *   **Impact:** Low. FAS 4 deals with partnership contracts where capital contributions can include tangible or intangible assets. While FAS 4 acknowledges intangible assets as valid capital, its focus is on their valuation at the time of contribution (often fair value) and the subsequent accounting for the partnership's assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, including profit/loss sharing. The proposed enhancements in FAS 10 focus on the *creation* of an asset (tangible or intangible) or provision of a service under a sale contract (Istisna'a). The detailed rules in the enhanced FAS 10 regarding specification during development, R&D costs, WIP measurement based on cost and contract price, and phased delivery are specific to the Istisna'a manufacturing/development process and do not directly impact the structure or accounting principles of a Musharakah partnership or the measurement of capital contributed to it.\n    *   **Contradictions:** No direct contradictions are identified. The standards address different contractual structures.\n    *   **Synergies:** There is a minor synergy in that both standards acknowledge the validity of intangible assets within Islamic finance contracts. The more detailed guidance on specifying intangible assets in the enhanced FAS 10 could potentially provide useful context for understanding how intangible assets might be described when contributed as capital in a Musharakah, but this is not a direct accounting or juristic linkage.\n\n2.  **FAS 7 (Salam and Parallel Salam):**\n    *   **Impact:** Medium. FAS 7 governs Salam contracts, which involve advance payment for specified goods delivered in the future. A key distinction between Istisna'a and Salam, particularly in some juristic views, relates to fixing the delivery date. Proposal 5 of the FAS 10 enhancement directly addresses delivery timelines for intangible assets/services under Istisna'a, clarifying that phased delivery or specifying timelines is permissible and helps mitigate Gharar. This clarification interacts directly with the potential distinction between Istisna'a and Salam. Furthermore, the expansion of Istisna'a scope (Proposal 1) to explicitly include services and intangible assets might overlap with the concept of \"benefit\" or \"kind\" that can be the subject matter of Salam (as mentioned in the FAS 7 basis for conclusions). Care is needed to ensure the boundaries between Istisna'a (for bespoke manufacturing/development) and Salam (for specified, often more fungible, future deliverables or services) remain clear, especially when dealing with intangible items or services.\n    *   **Contradictions:** No direct contradictions are introduced, but the enhancements highlight areas of potential confusion between the two contracts, particularly regarding subject matter type and delivery conditions for non-tangibles.\n    *   **Synergies:** Proposal 5 creates a synergy by directly addressing a point of potential confusion between the two contract types, providing clarity on the permissible structure of delivery timelines in Istisna'a for intangible/service projects, which helps reinforce the distinction from Salam.\n\n3.  **FAS 28 (Murabaha and Other Deferred Payment Sales):**\n    *   **Impact:** None. FAS 28 deals with the resale of an existing asset at a cost plus a profit margin. The subject matter is typically acquired by the seller before or concurrently with the sale to the buyer. The proposed enhancements to FAS 10 concern the process of *manufacturing, developing, or constructing* an asset or providing a service. These activities and their associated accounting complexities (WIP, R&D costs, percentage of completion) are not relevant to the fundamental structure of a Murabaha contract, which is a simple deferred sale of an acquired item.\n    *   **Contradictions:** No contradictions. The standards govern entirely different types of sale transactions.\n    *   **Synergies:** None.\n\n4.  **FAS 32 (Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek):**\n    *   **Impact:** Low. FAS 32 governs lease contracts where the usufruct of an asset (tangible or intangible) is transferred. The focus is on the lease period, rent recognition, asset depreciation/amortization, and potential transfer of ownership. The proposed enhancements to FAS 10 deal with the *creation* of an asset or the provision of a service under a sale contract. While both standards can potentially involve intangible assets as subject matter (creation in Istisna'a, leasing their usufruct in Ijarah), the accounting treatments and underlying principles are distinct (sale/WIP accounting vs. lease accounting).

    "cross_standard_analysis": "## Cross-Standard Impact Analysis\n\nThe proposed enhancements to FAS 10 primarily aim to clarify its application to intangible assets and services by refining definitions, specification requirements, cost treatment, work-in-progress measurement, and delivery considerations. These changes are designed to make the standard more relevant and applicable to modern contracts like software development, while remaining compliant with Shari'a principles.\n\nHere's an analysis of the potential impact on other selected AAOIFI standards:\n\n1.  **FAS 4 (Musharakah and Mudarabah):**\n    *   **Impact:** Low. FAS 4 deals with partnership contracts where capital contributions can include tangible or intangible assets. While FAS 4 acknowledges intangible assets as valid capital, its focus is on their valuation at the time of contribution (often fair value) and the subsequent accounting for the partnership's assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, including profit/loss sharing. The proposed enhancements in FAS 10 focus on the *creation* of an asset (tangible or intangible) or provision of a service under a sale contract (Istisna'a). The detailed rules in the enhanced FAS 10 regarding specification during development, R&D costs, WIP measurement based on cost and contract price, and phased delivery are specific to the Istisna'a manufacturing/development process and do not directly impact the structure or accounting principles of a Musharakah partnership or the measurement of capital contributed to it.\n    *   **Contradictions:** No direct contradictions are identified. The standards address different contractual structures.\n    *   **Synergies:** There is a minor synergy in that both standards acknowledge the validity of intangible assets within Islamic finance contracts. The more detailed guidance on specifying intangible assets in the enhanced FAS 10 could potentially provide useful context for understanding how intangible assets might be described when contributed as capital in a Musharakah, but this is not a direct accounting or juristic linkage.\n\n2.  **FAS 7 (Salam and Parallel Salam):**\n    *   **Impact:** Medium. FAS 7 governs Salam contracts, which involve advance payment for specified goods delivered in the future. A key distinction between Istisna'a and Salam, particularly in some juristic views, relates to fixing the delivery date. Proposal 5 of the FAS 10 enhancement directly addresses delivery timelines for intangible assets/services under Istisna'a, clarifying that phased delivery or specifying timelines is permissible and helps mitigate Gharar. This clarification interacts directly with the potential distinction between Istisna'a and Salam. Furthermore, the expansion of Istisna'a scope (Proposal 1) to explicitly include services and intangible assets might overlap with the concept of \"benefit\" or \"kind\" that can be the subject matter of Salam (as mentioned in the FAS 7 basis for conclusions). Care is needed to ensure the boundaries between Istisna'a (for bespoke manufacturing/development) and Salam (for specified, often more fungible, future deliverables or services) remain clear, especially when dealing with intangible items or services.\n    *   **Contradictions:** No direct contradictions are introduced, but the enhancements highlight areas of potential confusion between the two contracts, particularly regarding subject matter type and delivery conditions for non-tangibles.\n    *   **Synergies:** Proposal 5 creates a synergy by directly addressing a point of potential confusion between the two contract types, providing clarity on the permissible structure of delivery timelines in Istisna'a for intangible/service projects, which helps reinforce the distinction from Salam.\n\n3.  **FAS 28 (Murabaha and Other Deferred Payment Sales):**\n    *   **Impact:** None. FAS 28 deals with the resale of an existing asset at a cost plus a profit margin. The subject matter is typically acquired by the seller before or concurrently with the sale to the buyer. The proposed enhancements to FAS 10 concern the process of *manufacturing, developing, or constructing* an asset or providing a service. These activities and their associated accounting complexities (WIP, R&D costs, percentage of completion) are not relevant to the fundamental structure of a Murabaha contract, which is a simple deferred sale of an acquired item.\n    *   **Contradictions:** No contradictions. The standards govern entirely different types of sale transactions.\n    *   **Synergies:** None.\n\n4.  **FAS 32 (Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek):**\n    *   **Impact:** Low. FAS 32 governs lease contracts where the usufruct of an asset (tangible or intangible) is transferred. The focus is on the lease period, rent recognition, asset depreciation/amortization, and potential transfer of ownership. The proposed enhancements to FAS 10 deal with the *creation* of an asset or the provision of a service under a sale contract. While both standards can potentially involve intangible assets as subject matter (creation in Istisna'a, leasing their usufruct in Ijarah), the accounting treatments and underlying principles are distinct (sale/WIP accounting vs. lease accounting). The specific issues addressed in the FAS 10 proposals (specification for development, R&D costs, WIP measurement during creation) are not relevant to the leasing of a completed asset or its usufruct.\n    *   **Contradictions:** No contradictions. The standards govern different types of contracts (sale/manufacture vs. lease).\n    *   **Synergies:** A minor synergy exists as both standards acknowledge the potential for intangible assets to be involved in Islamic finance contracts. The explicit recognition in FAS 10 could indirectly support the understanding of intangible assets as valid subject matter in other contracts like Ijarah, although FAS 32 would require its own specific guidance for intangible leasing.\n\n## Compatibility Matrix\n\n| Standard ID | Impact Level | Impact Type |\n|-------------|--------------|-------------|\n| FAS 4       | Low          | Synergy     |\n| FAS 7       | Medium       | Synergy     |\n| FAS 10      | High         | Synergy     |\n| FAS 28      | None         | None        |\n| FAS 32      | Low          | Synergy     |\n\n*Note: The impact level for FAS 10 itself is listed as High/Synergy as the changes improve internal consistency and applicability, but the analysis focuses primarily on impacts on *other* standards.*\n\n## Recommendations\n\nTo maintain consistency and clarity across AAOIFI standards following the proposed enhancements to FAS 10:\n\n1.  **Reinforce Distinction with FAS 7 (Salam):** Ensure the wording in the enhanced FAS 10, particularly regarding delivery timelines and phased delivery for intangible assets/services (Proposal 5), clearly articulates how these structures are permissible within Istisna'a without causing the contract to be reclassified as Salam.
