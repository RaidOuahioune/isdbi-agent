    "review": "Okay, as the AAOIFI Standards Reviewer Agent, I have analyzed the request concerning AAOIFI FAS 10 (Istisna'a) in the context of structuring a contract for a large-scale AI software platform.\n\nBased on the trigger scenario highlighting potential issues with \"well-defined subject matter\" and \"determination of cost\" when applied to intangible assets like software, and understanding the typical scope and language of Istisna'a accounting standards which often focus on tangible manufacturing or construction, here are the findings regarding potential areas in FAS 10 that may need enhancement:\n\n**Trigger Scenario:** Applying AAOIFI FAS 10 to an Istisna'a contract for the development of a large-scale AI software platform.\n\n**Identified Issues:** Uncertainty regarding the applicability of requirements for \"well-defined subject matter\" and \"determination of cost\" to intangible assets like software.\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Analysis of Potential Enhancement Areas in FAS 10:**\n\n1.  **Section/Clause Area:** **Definition and Characteristics of the Istisna'a Subject Matter**\n    *   *Potential Gap or Ambiguity:* AAOIFI FAS 10, like many Istisna'a standards globally, is primarily framed around the manufacturing or construction of *tangible* assets (e.g., buildings, machinery, ships, furniture). The language used to describe the requirements for a \"well-defined subject matter\" typically implies physical characteristics, specifications, quantity, and quality standards applicable to physical goods. It may not explicitly address or provide guidance on how these requirements translate to *intangible* assets like software. Defining software in a \"well-defined\" manner upfront can be challenging due to its abstract nature, iterative development process, evolving requirements, and reliance on functional specifications rather than purely physical attributes.\n    *   *Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:* Applying criteria designed for physical objects (like dimensions, materials, structural integrity) to a complex AI software platform creates significant ambiguity. How do you define \"quantity\" (lines of code? features? modules?) or \"quality\" (performance metrics? bug count? user satisfaction?) in a way that satisfies the standard's potential requirements for precise definition at contract inception? This ambiguity can lead to uncertainty about whether a software development contract even *qualifies* as a valid Istisna'a under the standard, impacting its Shariah compliance and the appropriate accounting treatment. The standard lacks specific guidance on how to interpret or adapt the \"well-defined\" requirement for non-physical outputs.\n\n2.  **Section/Clause Area:** **Recognition and Measurement of Istisna'a Costs**\n    *   *Potential Gap or Ambiguity:* The standard's guidance on determining and recognizing the cost of an Istisna'a contract is likely structured around costs typically associated with physical production: direct materials, direct labor involved in manufacturing/construction, and attributable manufacturing overheads. While some principles are transferable, the cost structure for software development is different. It heavily involves highly skilled labor (developers, data scientists, project managers), significant infrastructure costs (cloud computing, servers, licenses for development tools), data acquisition costs, and ongoing testing/refinement costs that may not fit neatly into traditional \"manufacturing cost\" categories. The standard may not explicitly list or provide guidance on the recognition of these specific types of costs common in software development.\n    *   *Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:* The financial institution and the developer need clear guidance on what constitutes the 'cost of the Istisna'a contract' for an AI platform. Without specific inclusion or adaptation for software-related costs (like cloud usage, data licensing, specialized software tools, different types of labor), there's a risk of miscategorizing costs, omitting relevant expenses, or struggling to apply the standard's cost measurement principles accurately. This affects the calculation of project profitability, the measurement of progress (if percentage of completion is used), and ultimately, the fair presentation of the financial position and performance of the Istisna'a contract.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nFAS 10, likely drafted with tangible assets in mind, presents challenges when applied to complex intangible assets like AI software platforms. The requirements for defining the subject matter and recognizing/measuring costs need clarification or expansion to explicitly address the unique nature of software development. This involves providing guidance on how to interpret \"well-defined\" for functional/performance specifications rather than physical ones, and how to account for the specific types of costs incurred in creating software (skilled labor, infrastructure, data, etc.). Enhancing these sections would provide much-needed clarity and consistency for Islamic financial institutions engaging in Istisna'a contracts for technology and digital assets.",

The language used to describe the requirements for a \"well-defined subject matter\" typically implies physical characteristics, specifications, quantity, and quality standards applicable to physical goods. It may not explicitly address or provide guidance on how these requirements translate to *intangible* assets like software. Defining software in a \"well-defined\" manner upfront can be challenging due to its abstract nature, iterative development process, evolving requirements, and reliance on functional specifications rather than purely physical attributes.\\n    *   *Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:* Applying criteria designed for physical objects (like dimensions, materials, structural integrity) to a complex AI software platform creates significant ambiguity. How do you define \"quantity\" (lines of code? features? modules?) or \"quality\" (performance metrics? bug count? user satisfaction?) in a way that satisfies the standard\\'s potential requirements for precise definition at contract inception? This ambiguity can lead to uncertainty about whether a software development contract even *qualifies* as a valid Istisna\\'a under the standard, impacting its Shariah compliance and the appropriate accounting treatment. The standard lacks specific guidance on how to interpret or adapt the \"well-defined\" requirement for non-physical outputs.\\n\\n2.  **Section/Clause Area:** **Recognition and Measurement of Istisna\\'a Costs**\\n    *   *Potential Gap or Ambiguity:* The standard\\'s guidance on determining and recognizing the cost of an Istisna\\'a contract is likely structured around costs typically associated with physical production: direct materials, direct labor involved in manufacturing/construction, and attributable manufacturing overheads. While some principles are transferable, the cost structure for software development is different. It heavily involves highly skilled labor (developers, data scientists, project managers), significant infrastructure costs (cloud computing, servers, licenses for development tools), data acquisition costs, and ongoing testing/refinement costs that may not fit neatly into traditional \"manufacturing cost\" categories. The standard may not explicitly list or provide guidance on the recognition of these specific types of costs common in software development.\\n    *   *Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:* The financial institution and the developer need clear guidance on what constitutes the \\'cost of the Istisna\\'a contract\\' for an AI platform. Without specific inclusion or adaptation for software-related costs (like cloud usage, data licensing, specialized software tools, different types of labor), there\\'s a risk of miscategorizing costs, omitting relevant expenses, or struggling to apply the standard\\'s cost measurement principles accurately. This affects the calculation of project profitability, the measurement of progress (if percentage of completion is used), and ultimately, the fair presentation of the financial position and performance of the Istisna\\'a contract.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Summary:**\\n\\nFAS 10, likely drafted with tangible assets in mind, presents challenges when applied to complex intangible assets like AI software platforms. The requirements for defining the subject matter and recognizing/measuring costs need clarification or expansion to explicitly address the unique nature of software development. This involves providing guidance on how to interpret \"well-defined\" for functional/performance specifications rather than physical ones, and how to account for the specific types of costs incurred in creating software (skilled labor, infrastructure, data, etc.). Enhancing these sections would provide much-needed clarity and consistency for Islamic financial institutions engaging in Istisna\\'a contracts for technology and digital assets.'}, 'validation_result': 'Okay, as the Standards Validator Agent, I have reviewed the proposed enhancement to AAOIFI FAS 10 regarding the application of Istisna\\'a to intangible assets like software.\\n\\nHere is the validation:\\n\\n**Evaluation of Proposed Enhancement 1: Clarifying the Definition of the Subject Matter for Intangible Assets**\\n\\n*   **Proposed Change:** Add Clause X.1.1 under the definition of Subject Matter (Clause X.1) to specify how the \"well-defined subject matter\" requirement is met for intangible assets like software, focusing on functional/technical specifications, performance metrics, scope, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.\\n\\n*   **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\\n    *   **Core Principle: Prohibition of Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty):** A fundamental condition for the validity of Istisna\\'a is that the subject matter (Al-Masnoo\\') must be \"known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its: a) Kind, b) Type, c) Quality, and d) Quantity\" (FAS 10 Para 4/1/1). This requirement is crucial to prevent Gharar. The original standard, likely written with tangible assets in mind, provides examples (car, aeroplane, house) that relate to physical attributes. Applying these directly to intangible assets like software creates significant ambiguity and potential Gharar.\\n    *   The proposed enhancement *directly addresses* this potential Gharar by providing a framework for defining intangible assets using criteria relevant to their nature (functional specs, performance, deliverables). This clarifies how the essential Shariah requirement of specifying the subject matter can be fulfilled for software. By providing clear definitional elements, it reduces the uncertainty that would otherwise exist.\\n    *   **Core Principle: Asset-Backing:** Istisna\\'a is based on the creation of a specific, defined asset. The proposal clarifies how an intangible asset can be considered a specific, defined output, supporting the asset-backing principle by ensuring the contract relates to a real, albeit non-physical, economic output.\\n    *   **Conclusion:** This proposal is fully compliant with Shariah principles, particularly by mitigating Gharar and supporting the asset-backing requirement in the context of intangible assets.\\n\\n*   **Consistency Check:**\\n    *   **Internal Consistency (FAS 10):** The proposal does not alter the core requirement of a \"well-defined subject matter\" in Clause X.1. Instead, it provides a specific interpretation and application of this existing requirement for a different class of assets. It maps the concepts of \"Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity\" (FAS 10 Para 4/1/1) to relevant software characteristics (functional specs, technical requirements, performance metrics, scope, deliverables, etc.). This maintains the spirit and structure of the original standard while extending its applicability.\\n    *   **External Consistency (Related Standards):** While FAS 10 primarily focuses on manufacturing/construction, other AAOIFI standards acknowledge intangible assets. For example, FAS 4 (Musharaka) Appendix D mentions \"real or intangible assets\" as Musharaka capital. The principle of defining and valuing intangible assets is not alien to AAOIFI standards. The proposed approach to defining intangible assets by specification aligns with the general need for clarity and definition of assets in Islamic finance contracts.\\n\\n*   **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\\n    *   Defining software by physical attributes is impossible and impractical. Software development contracts are inherently defined by functional specifications, technical requirements, performance metrics, scope, deliverables, and acceptance criteria. The proposed language reflects standard industry practice for defining software projects. It provides practical and implementable guidance for financial institutions and developers structuring Istisna\\'a contracts for software.\\n\\n*   **Conclusion on Enhancement 1:** The proposed enhancement is Shariah-compliant, consistent with the standard\\'s principles, and highly practical. It effectively addresses the identified ambiguity for intangible assets.\\n\\n**Evaluation of Proposed Enhancement 2: Clarifying Cost Recognition for Intangible Assets**\\n\\n*   **Proposed Change:** Add Clause Y.1.1 under Recognition and Measurement of Costs (Clause Y.1) to specify which costs are included in the cost of an Istisna\\'a contract for intangible assets, providing examples relevant to software development (skilled labor, infrastructure, data, testing, documentation) and reinforcing the exclusion of general administrative/marketing costs.\\n\\n*   **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\\n    *   **Core Principles:** Cost recognition is primarily an accounting measurement issue, not a direct Shariah validity issue, as long as it doesn\\'t facilitate prohibited elements like Riba or Gharar. Accurate cost measurement is necessary for correctly calculating the profit (which must be derived from the sale price fixed at inception, not interest-based). The proposed clarification on which costs are attributable to the creation of the intangible asset supports accurate profit calculation.\\n    *   **Conclusion:** This proposal does not violate any core Shariah principles. It supports the financial reporting requirements derived from Shariah-compliant contracts.\\n\\n*   **Consistency Check:**\\n    *   **Internal Consistency (FAS 10):** The original FAS 10 states that costs include \"Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo\\'; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis\" and explicitly excludes \"General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs\" (FAS 10 Para 2/1(a)). The proposed enhancement aligns perfectly with this existing framework. It simply provides examples of *what constitutes* direct and attributable indirect costs *in the context of intangible asset creation*. The listed examples (skilled labor, specific infrastructure/tools, testing) are direct costs or costs directly attributable to the development effort, consistent with the general principle. The explicit exclusion of general admin/marketing costs reinforces the existing standard.\\n    *   **External Consistency (Related Standards):** The concept of capitalizing costs directly attributable to bringing an asset (including intangible assets) to its intended use is a widely accepted accounting principle (e.g., IFRS, FASB). While AAOIFI has its own standards, alignment with general sound accounting practices where they do not conflict with Shariah principles is beneficial for comparability and clarity. This proposal aligns with this broader principle.\\n\\n*   **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\\n    *   The costs listed in the proposal are the typical and significant costs incurred in software development projects. Providing these examples makes the standard\\'s cost recognition requirements practical and applicable to this type of Istisna\\'a contract. It removes ambiguity for financial institutions and auditors regarding which expenditures should be capitalized as part of the Istisna\\'a asset.\\n\\n*   **Conclusion on Enhancement 2:** The proposed enhancement is consistent with the standard\\'s existing cost principles and is highly practical for accounting for intangible asset development costs under Istisna\\'a.\\n\\n**Final Decision:**\\n\\nBased on the validation checks, both proposed enhancements:\\n1.  Are compliant with core Shariah principles, particularly by clarifying how to reduce Gharar when dealing with intangible assets.\\n2.  Maintain consistency with the existing framework and principles of AAOIFI FAS 10 and related standards.\\n3.  Provide practical and implementable guidance relevant to modern financial activities involving technology and intangible assets.\\n\\nThe proposed changes effectively address the identified gaps and uncertainties without introducing any Shariah non-compliance or inconsistency.\\n\\n**APPROVED.**'}",

and distinct; it merely provides an interpretation applicable to a different class of assets, aligning with the potential for Istisna&#x27;a to be used for various types of &#x27;making&#x27; or &#x27;constructing&#x27;.</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   **Supports Modern Applications:** Facilitates the application of Istisna&#x27;a to modern assets like software, which is increasingly relevant for financial institutions.</span> <span class=\"addition\">---\n\n**Proposed Enhancement 2: Clarifying Cost Recognition for Intangible Assets**\n\n**Identified Issue:** The standard&#x27;s guidance on cost determination likely focuses on traditional manufacturing/construction costs, lacking clarity on costs specific to software development.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Simulated Original Text (Representative of the potential focus on tangible asset costs):**\n\n*   *Note: This is simulated text reflecting the analysis&#x27;s description, not necessarily the exact wording from FAS 10.*\n\n    **Clause Y.1 Recognition and Measurement of Costs:**\n    The cost of an Istisna&#x27;a contract shall comprise costs that relate directly to the specific contract and costs that are attributable to contract activity in general and can be allocated to the contract.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Direct costs include direct materials, direct labor, and other costs directly incurred on the contract.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Costs attributable to contract activity in general include manufacturing overheads and design costs.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n*   *Note: Added text is **bolded**.*\n\n    **Clause Y.1 Recognition and Measurement of Costs:**\n    The cost of an Istisna&#x27;a contract shall comprise costs that relate directly to the specific contract and costs that are attributable to contract activity in general and can be allocated to the contract.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Direct costs include direct materials, direct labor, and other costs directly incurred on the contract.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Costs attributable to contract activity in general include manufacturing overheads and design costs.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Y.1.1 Application to Intangible Assets:**\n    **When the subject matter of the Istisna&#x27;a contract is an intangible asset, the costs of the contract shall include all expenditures directly attributable to the process of creating, developing, and preparing the intangible asset for its intended use as specified in the contract.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Examples of such costs, in addition to general direct labor and attributable overheads, may include:**\n    *   **Costs of materials or data specifically acquired or used for the development (e.g., datasets, specialized APIs).**\n    *   **Costs of highly skilled labor directly involved in the development process (e.g., software developers, data scientists, system architects, project managers).**\n    *   **Costs of using specialized development tools, software licenses, or infrastructure (e.g., cloud computing services, development environment licenses) directly related to the contract.**\n    *   **Testing, quality assurance, and refinement costs necessary to meet the contract specifications.**\n    *   **Costs of technical documentation and training materials required by the contract.**\n    **Costs that are not directly attributable to the contract, such as general administrative overheads or costs of marketing/sales efforts not required by the contract, should be excluded.**\n\n**Rationale for Change:**\n\n*   **Addresses Ambiguity:** Provides specific guidance on what types of costs are includable in the cost of an Istisna&#x27;a contract for intangible assets, which have different cost structures than tangible assets.</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   **Enhances Clarity:** Lists examples of common costs incurred in software/intangible asset development, making the standard more practical for institutions engaging in such contracts.</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   **Maintains Compatibility:** Aligns with the existing principle of including directly attributable costs; it simply provides context and examples relevant to intangible asset creation.</span> <span class=\"addition\">It also implicitly aligns with general accounting principles for capitalizing internally developed intangible assets where directly attributable costs are included.</span> <span class=\"addition\">*   **Supports Modern Applications:** Ensures that the accounting for Istisna&#x27;a of intangible assets accurately reflects the economic substance of the development process.</span> <span class=\"addition\">---\n\nThese proposed enhancements aim to provide the necessary clarity and guidance within AAOIFI FAS 10 to effectively apply it to modern contracts involving intangible assets like large-scale AI software platforms, thereby addressing the identified uncertainties regarding subject matter definition and cost determination.</span> ",
