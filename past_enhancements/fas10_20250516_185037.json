This determined price is binding. For contracts involving the manufacture or development of complex, novel, or intangible assets where precise cost estimation at the outset may present challenges (e.g., large-scale software development with R&D components), this requirement necessitates agreeing upon a fixed price based on the best available information, detailed scope definition, and rigorous estimation methodologies at the time of contract signing.\n\nPricing models where the final price is solely determined *after* completion based purely on accrued costs (such as open-ended 'cost-plus' or 'time-and-materials' without a defined ceiling or scope limit linked to the determined price principle) are generally not consistent with the Istisna'a requirement of a determined price at contract inception.\n\nHowever, the determined price for such projects can incorporate mechanisms to manage *known* estimation uncertainties within Shariah parameters, such as:\na) Including a clearly defined and agreed-upon contingency within the overall fixed price.\nb) Structuring the contract with fixed prices for specific, clearly defined phases or milestones, agreed upon upfront.\nc) Including clauses for price adjustments *only* in response to specific, verifiable events or formal change orders requested by the buyer that result in a modification of the agreed-upon scope or specifications.

    "review": "Okay, as the AAOIFI Standards Reviewer Agent, I will analyze AAOIFI FAS 10 (Istisna'a and Parallel Istisna'a) in the context of structuring an Istisna'a contract for a large-scale AI software platform, focusing on the challenges related to \"well-defined subject matter\" and \"determination of cost.\"\n\nAAOIFI FAS 10 provides the accounting and Shariah requirements for Istisna'a contracts. While Istisna'a is a versatile contract for manufacturing or construction, applying it to complex, intangible assets like bespoke software, particularly AI software, can highlight areas where the standard's current wording, primarily developed with tangible assets in mind, may present ambiguities or gaps.\n\nHere is an analysis of potential areas needing enhancement in FAS 10 based on the trigger scenario:\n\n**1. Section/Concept Analyzed:** Requirement for \"Well-defined Subject Matter\" (Masoof Wasfuhu)\n\n*   **Underlying Principle in FAS 10:** A fundamental requirement for a valid Istisna'a contract is that the subject matter (the asset to be manufactured or constructed) must be clearly and specifically defined at the time the contract is concluded. This definition should include essential characteristics, specifications, quantity, and quality to avoid Gharar (excessive uncertainty) and disputes.\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** FAS 10's language and underlying examples are heavily oriented towards tangible assets (buildings, machines, goods). Defining a \"large-scale AI software platform\" clearly and specifically *ab initio* presents unique challenges not explicitly addressed:\n    *   **Intangible Nature:** Software is not a physical object. Its \"specifications\" relate to functionality, performance, architecture, algorithms, data handling, user experience, etc. While these *can* be defined, the level of detail required for a \"large-scale AI platform\" is vastly more complex and abstract than for a tangible asset.\n    *   **Evolving Requirements:** AI development is often iterative and involves significant R&D. The final scope, features, and even underlying algorithms might evolve based on initial results, data availability, testing, and changing business needs. Defining the *entire* platform exhaustively at the outset in a fixed manner is often impractical or leads to rigid contracts ill-suited for software innovation.\n    *   **Complexity and Novelty:** A \"large-scale AI platform\" likely involves novel components and integrations. Describing these in sufficient detail to meet a strict interpretation of \"well-defined\" without building prototypes or conducting significant preliminary work (which itself has cost implications) is difficult.\n    *   **Measurability:** Defining \"quality\" for AI software can be subjective (e.g., accuracy of predictions, robustness to edge cases) and harder to specify and measure objectively compared to the quality of physical materials or construction.\n*   **Why this is an Issue in the Trigger Scenario:**\n    *   Structuring the Istisna'a contract becomes difficult. A strict interpretation of FAS 10 could require an impractical level of upfront specification for the AI platform, making the contract rigid and potentially unsuitable for the agile, iterative nature of software development.\n    *   It creates uncertainty for both the financial institution (as funder/buyer in a parallel Istisna'a) and the developer (as seller) regarding what constitutes successful delivery according to the initial definition, especially if requirements need to adapt.\n    *   It raises questions about Shariah compliance if the level of Gharar introduced by the inherent uncertainty in defining complex, evolving software is deemed excessive under the standard's requirements.\n*   **Areas Needing Enhancement:** The standard could benefit from:\n    *   Adding specific guidance or interpretations on applying the \"well-defined subject matter\" requirement to *intangible* assets, particularly complex software.\n    *   Providing flexibility for defining the subject matter in phases or through detailed functional specifications and acceptance criteria, acknowledging that the final form may evolve within defined parameters.\n    *   Addressing how changes in scope or specifications during development are handled in a manner consistent with the initial contract definition and Shariah principles.\n\n**2. Section/Concept Analyzed:** Requirement for \"Determination of Cost/Price\" (Tahdeed Al-Thaman)\n\n*   **Underlying Principle in FAS 10:** The price of the Istisna'a contract must be determined and agreed upon at the time the contract is concluded. This price is fixed and binding on both parties, although variations might be allowed under specific, limited circumstances (e.g., significant unforeseen events, though this is debated among scholars). The price is typically based on the estimated cost of manufacturing/construction plus a profit margin.\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** Determining a fixed, binding price for a large-scale AI software platform *at the outset* is often highly challenging due to inherent uncertainties in development costs:\n    *   **Unpredictable Development Effort:** The effort required for complex software, especially AI (involving R&D, algorithm training, data preparation, unexpected technical hurdles), is notoriously difficult to estimate accurately upfront.\n    *   **Variable Input Costs:** Costs might depend on factors that are hard to predict, such as the amount of data needed, computational resources for training, or the number of iterations required to achieve desired performance levels.\n    *   **Scope Creep and Iteration:** While ideally defined upfront, software projects often involve scope changes or require more iterations than initially planned, directly impacting cost.\n    *   **Lack of Standardized Costing:** Unlike building materials or manufacturing processes, software development costs lack universally standardized units or readily available market prices for specific components or efforts, making estimation more bespoke and uncertain.\n*   **Why this is an Issue in the Trigger Scenario:**\n    *   For the financial institution (as buyer/funder), requiring a strictly fixed price based on uncertain upfront cost estimations exposes the developer (seller) to significant risk of cost overruns, potentially leading to project failure or disputes. This risk is higher than in traditional manufacturing/construction.\n    *   It might push parties towards cost structures that are less aligned with a fixed-price Istisna'a, such as time-and-materials or cost-plus, which may not strictly fit the \"price determined at contract\" requirement of FAS 10 without careful structuring and justification.\n    *   The standard doesn't provide clear guidance on how to handle the specific types of cost uncertainties prevalent in complex software development within the framework of a determined price.\n*   **Areas Needing Enhancement:** The standard could benefit from:\n    *   Providing guidance on how cost estimation uncertainty for complex, novel projects (including intangibles like software) can be addressed while adhering to the principle of price determination at contract signing.\n    *   Exploring acceptable mechanisms within the Istisna'a framework for managing cost variability inherent in R&D-heavy projects, perhaps through defined parameters for cost adjustments or specific contractual clauses permitted under Shariah for such circumstances.\n    *   Clarifying how different pricing models common in software development (if structured appropriately) can align with the Istisna'a requirement for a determined price.\n\nIn summary, while Istisna'a is theoretically applicable to the creation of intangible assets like software, applying FAS 10's specific requirements for \"well-defined subject matter\" and \"determination of cost\" to a complex, evolving AI software platform highlights areas where the standard, currently more aligned with tangible assets, lacks the necessary nuance and guidance. Enhancement in these areas would provide clarity and facilitate the structuring of Shariah-compliant finance for modern technological projects.",

Section/Concept Analyzed:** Requirement for \"Well-defined Subject Matter\" (Masoof Wasfuhu)\\n\\n*   **Underlying Principle in FAS 10:** A fundamental requirement for a valid Istisna\\'a contract is that the subject matter (the asset to be manufactured or constructed) must be clearly and specifically defined at the time the contract is concluded. This definition should include essential characteristics, specifications, quantity, and quality to avoid Gharar (excessive uncertainty) and disputes.\\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** FAS 10\\'s language and underlying examples are heavily oriented towards tangible assets (buildings, machines, goods). Defining a \"large-scale AI software platform\" clearly and specifically *ab initio* presents unique challenges not explicitly addressed:\\n    *   **Intangible Nature:** Software is not a physical object. Its \"specifications\" relate to functionality, performance, architecture, algorithms, data handling, user experience, etc. While these *can* be defined, the level of detail required for a \"large-scale AI platform\" is vastly more complex and abstract than for a tangible asset.\\n    *   **Evolving Requirements:** AI development is often iterative and involves significant R&D. The final scope, features, and even underlying algorithms might evolve based on initial results, data availability, testing, and changing business needs. Defining the *entire* platform exhaustively at the outset in a fixed manner is often impractical or leads to rigid contracts ill-suited for software innovation.\\n    *   **Complexity and Novelty:** A \"large-scale AI platform\" likely involves novel components and integrations.

Enhancement in these areas would provide clarity and facilitate the structuring of Shariah-compliant finance for modern technological projects.'}, 'validation_result': 'Okay, acting as the Standards Validator Agent, I will evaluate the proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 against the specified criteria.\\n\\n**Proposed Enhancement 1: Clarifying \"Well-defined Subject Matter\" for Intangible Assets**\\n\\n**Proposal Summary:**\\nThe proposal suggests adding guidance to FAS 10 stating that for intangible assets like software, the \"well-defined subject matter\" requirement is met through detailed functional, technical, performance, and acceptance specifications. It acknowledges the complexity and iterative nature, allowing phased definitions if phases are clear and overall objectives understood, and requiring formal amendments for scope changes.\\n\\n**Validation Checks:**\\n\\n1.  **Shariah Compliance Assessment (Gharar):**\\n    *   **Principle:** The requirement for a \"well-defined subject matter\" (Masoof Wasfuhu) is rooted in the prohibition of excessive Gharar (uncertainty) in contracts. The parties must know what they are contracting for to avoid disputes and potential exploitation.\\n    *   **Assessment:** The proposed enhancement directly addresses the challenge of applying this principle to intangible assets. By specifying that functional, technical, performance, and acceptance criteria serve as the definition for software, it provides a clear framework for describing the subject matter in a manner relevant to its nature. Allowing phased definitions, *provided each phase\\'s specifications and deliverables are clear upfront*, manages the Gharar associated with project complexity. Requiring formal amendments for changes ensures that the *current* scope remains defined throughout the project lifecycle. This approach appears to effectively mitigate excessive Gharar in the context of complex intangible asset development, aligning with the Shariah principle.\\n\\n2.  **Consistency Check (FAS 10 & Related Standards):**\\n    *   **FAS 10 Consistency:** FAS 10, Para 4/1/1 requires the subject matter to be \"known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its: a) Kind, b) Type, c) Quality, and d) Quantity.\" The proposal doesn\\'t contradict this but provides an interpretation for *how* these aspects are defined for intangible assets (e.g., \"Kind/Type\" becomes functional/technical specs, \"Quality\" becomes performance/acceptance criteria, \"Quantity\" relates to scope/features). It aligns with the standard\\'s objective of ensuring clarity. Furthermore, FAS 10, Footnote 7 mentions that the subject matter \"may be a commodity, service or both,\" implicitly allowing for non-tangible elements. The proposal aligns with this broader interpretation.\\n    *   **Consistency with Related Standards:** FAS 4 (Musharaka) Appendix D mentions intangible assets being contributed to capital and requiring valuation by agreement, showing that AAOIFI standards *can* accommodate intangible assets. The approach in the proposal is consistent with the general direction of adapting principles to modern asset classes.\\n\\n3.  **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\\n    *   **Assessment:** Defining software via detailed specifications (functional, technical, etc.), structuring projects in phases, and managing scope changes through formal amendments are standard, widely adopted practices in the software development industry. The proposed guidance aligns well with established project management and contractual norms for complex software development, making it highly practical for financial institutions and developers to implement.\\n\\n**Proposed Enhancement 2: Clarifying \"Determination of Cost/Price\" for Projects with High Uncertainty**\\n\\n**Proposal Summary:**\\nThe proposal reiterates that the Istisna\\'a price must be determined and fixed at contract inception. It clarifies that open-ended cost-plus or time-and-materials without a ceiling are generally not compliant. It suggests compliant mechanisms for managing estimation uncertainty, such as fixed price with contingency, fixed prices for defined phases, or price adjustments only via formal change orders linked to scope modifications.\\n\\n**Validation Checks:**\\n\\n1.  **Shariah Compliance Assessment (Fixed Price, Gharar):**\\n    *   **Principle:** A fundamental requirement of Istisna\\'a is a fixed and determined price (Tahdeed Al-Thaman) known at the time of contracting. This is crucial to avoid Gharar in the price itself and distinguish it from other contract types.\\n    *   **Assessment:** The proposal correctly identifies and reiterates the core requirement for a determined price. It explicitly prohibits pricing models (open-ended cost-plus/T&M) that violate this principle by leaving the final price undetermined at inception. The suggested compliant mechanisms (fixed price with contingency, phased fixed prices, price adjustments for formal scope changes) are all methods where the price (or the price for a specific phase/scope) *is* determined at the relevant point in time (inception for the whole contract/phase, or upon formal amendment for scope changes). These methods allow for managing the inherent uncertainty in estimating complex project costs *within* the constraint of a fixed price framework, rather than abandoning the principle. This aligns with the Shariah requirement of a determined price while offering practical ways to handle estimation risk.\\n\\n2.  **Consistency Check (FAS 10 & Related Standards):**\\n    *   **FAS 10 Consistency:** FAS 10 implicitly assumes a determined price when discussing profit calculation and valuation of work-in-progress. Critically, FAS 10 already includes provisions for \"Change Orders\" and \"Additional Claims\" (Para 24, 26, and definitions in Appendix G), which allow for price adjustments under specific, verifiable conditions (legal basis, unforeseeable events not due to Sani\\'s fault) that affect contract costs and scope. The proposal builds upon this existing concept, extending it to explicitly cover price adjustments for scope changes in complex projects via formal amendments, reinforcing the need for a *new determined price* for the modified scope. This is consistent with the standard\\'s existing allowance for defined variations.\\n    *   **Consistency with Related Standards:** No direct conflicts or strong supporting references found in the provided snippets of other standards regarding price determination methods specific to Istisna\\'a, but the general emphasis on clarity in contracts is consistent.\\n\\n3.  **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\\n    *   **Assessment:** Fixed-price contracts (sometimes with a contingency element) and phased payment/pricing structures are common and implementable in the software development industry, particularly when scope can be reasonably defined for the overall project or for specific phases. While challenging for highly exploratory R&D, the proposal provides the most compliant methods possible within the Istisna\\'a framework. Prohibiting open-ended cost-plus/T&M aligns the financing structure with the Istisna\\'a contract type, which is a necessary constraint for Shariah compliance via Istisna\\'a. The guidance is practical for applying Istisna\\'a to suitable software projects.\\n\\n**Final Decision:**\\n\\n**APPROVED**\\n\\n**Detailed Reasoning:**\\n\\nThe proposed enhancements provide much-needed clarity and practical guidance for applying the established principles of AAOIFI FAS 10 to modern, complex, intangible assets like large-scale AI software platforms.\\n\\n1.  **Shariah Compliance:** Both proposals uphold core Shariah principles. Enhancement 1 addresses Gharar by providing a relevant framework for defining intangible subject matter through detailed specifications and structured phases, ensuring the *what* is known. Enhancement 2 reinforces the crucial requirement of a determined price, prohibiting non-compliant open-ended models while offering Shariah-compliant mechanisms (fixed price, phased pricing, formal change orders with determined price adjustments) to manage cost estimation uncertainty inherent in complex projects. Neither introduces Riba or Maysir.\\n2.  **Consistency:** The proposals maintain consistency with the intent and existing provisions of FAS 10. They do not alter the fundamental requirements of a well-defined subject matter and a determined price but rather provide practical interpretations and mechanisms for applying these requirements to a new asset class. Enhancement 1 aligns with the standard\\'s allowance for services/non-tangible elements. Enhancement 2 builds upon the existing concept of handling change orders and additional claims with price adjustments.\\n3.  **Practicality:** The suggested approaches (defining by specifications, phased development, fixed/phased pricing, formal change orders) are standard practices in relevant industries (software development, complex projects), making the guidance implementable by financial institutions and contractors.\\n\\nThe proposed enhancements successfully bridge the gap between a standard primarily framed for tangible assets and the realities of financing complex intangible development, facilitating Shariah-compliant financing for technological innovation while strictly adhering to the core principles of Istisna\\'a.'}",

For contracts involving the manufacture or development of complex, novel, or intangible assets where precise cost estimation at the outset may present challenges (e.g., large-scale software development with R&amp;D components), this requirement necessitates agreeing upon a fixed price based on the best available information, detailed scope definition, and rigorous estimation methodologies at the time of contract signing.\n\nPricing models where the final price is solely determined *after* completion based purely on accrued costs (such as open-ended &#x27;cost-plus&#x27; or &#x27;time-and-materials&#x27; without a defined ceiling or scope limit linked to the determined price principle) are generally not consistent with the Istisna&#x27;a requirement of a determined price at contract inception.\n\nHowever, the determined price for such projects can incorporate mechanisms to manage *known* estimation uncertainties within Shariah parameters, such as:\na) Including a clearly defined and agreed-upon contingency within the overall fixed price.\nb) Structuring the contract with fixed prices for specific, clearly defined phases or milestones, agreed upon upfront.\nc) Including clauses for price adjustments *only* in response to specific, verifiable events or formal change orders requested by the buyer that result in a modification of the agreed-upon scope or specifications. Any such adjustment must lead to a *new* determined price for the modified scope or circumstances through a formal contract amendment.\n\nRigorous upfront estimation, clear scope definition as per the guidance on Subject Matter, and transparent contractual terms regarding the determined price and potential adjustments are essential for compliance.&quot;\n\n**Rationale for Proposed Change:**\n\n1.  **Reaffirms Core Principle:** Starts by reiterating the fundamental Shariah requirement of a determined price at contract inception.\n2.  **Acknowledges Challenge:** Explicitly recognizes the difficulty of precise upfront cost estimation for complex, novel projects and intangible assets like software.\n3.  **Provides Clarity on Incompatible Models:** Clearly states that open-ended cost-plus or time-and-materials models, which lack a determined price at inception, are generally not suitable for Istisna&#x27;a, guiding practitioners away from potentially non-compliant structures.\n4.  **Suggests Compliant Mechanisms:** Offers concrete, acceptable methods (contingency, phased pricing, formal change orders with determined price adjustments) for managing estimation uncertainty within the fixed-price framework required by Istisna&#x27;a.\n5.  **Promotes Good Practice:** Emphasizes the importance of rigorous upfront estimation and clear contractual terms, which are crucial for managing complex projects effectively and compliantly.\n6.  **Facilitates Application:** Provides practical pathways for structuring Istisna&#x27;a contracts for modern technological projects that have inherent cost uncertainties, enabling Shariah-compliant finance for innovation.\n\n---\n\nThese proposed enhancements aim to provide necessary guidance and flexibility within AAOIFI FAS 10 to accommodate the specific characteristics of complex, intangible assets like large-scale AI software platforms, thereby facilitating their financing through Shariah-compliant Istisna&#x27;a structures while upholding the core principles of the contract.</span>",
      "sentence_diff_html": "<span class=\"deletion\">Dr.</span> <span class=\"deletion\">Abdul Sattar Abughoddah\n10.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Okay, acting as the Standards Enhancement Proposer Agent, I will propose specific text enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 based on the detailed analysis provided, focusing on addressing the challenges of applying the standard to intangible, complex assets like AI software platforms.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Since the provided &quot;Original Text&quot; is minimal (&quot;Dr.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Abdul Sattar Abughoddah 10.&quot;), I will assume the need to *add* guidance or interpretations to the standard, potentially within its explanatory notes or specific application guidance sections, rather than modifying an existing paragraph 10 directly.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Here are the proposed enhancements:\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 1: Clarifying &quot;Well-defined Subject Matter&quot; for Intangible Assets**\n\n**Issue:** The standard&#x27;s requirement for a &quot;well-defined subject matter&quot; (Masoof Wasfuhu) is primarily framed for tangible assets, creating ambiguity when applied to complex, intangible assets like software whose specifications are functional, technical, and potentially evolving.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Original Text (Placeholder - Assuming no direct original text to modify, this is proposed as new guidance):**\n*(No specific paragraph provided in the original request to modify.</span> <span class=\"addition\">This proposal suggests adding new guidance.)*\n\n**Proposed Modified Text (Addition to FAS 10 Guidance/Explanatory Notes):**\n\n**[Proposed New Section/Paragraph Title: Application of &#x27;Well-defined Subject Matter&#x27; to Intangible Assets]**\n\n&quot;For Istisna&#x27;a contracts involving the manufacture or development of intangible assets, such as software, digital platforms, or specific intellectual property, the requirement for the subject matter to be well-defined at the time of contract conclusion shall be met through detailed functional, technical, and performance specifications.</span> <span class=\"addition\">These specifications, rather than physical attributes, must clearly describe the characteristics, scope, functionality, architecture, interfaces, data handling, required performance levels, and acceptance criteria of the intangible asset to be delivered.</span> <span class=\"addition\">While acknowledging the inherent complexity and potential for iterative development in creating novel intangible assets, particularly those involving research and development elements like advanced AI, the core scope, essential features, and key performance indicators of the subject matter must be sufficiently defined upfront to eliminate excessive Gharar (uncertainty).</span> <span class=\"addition\">The definition can be structured in phases, provided the specifications and deliverables for each phase are clearly delineated and agreed upon at contract inception, and the overall objectives and parameters of the final asset are understood.</span> <span class=\"addition\">Any subsequent refinement of specifications or changes to the scope during the development process must be handled through formal contract amendments that clearly define the modified subject matter and any resulting adjustments to the price or delivery schedule, ensuring that the principle of a well-defined subject matter for the agreed-upon scope remains upheld.&quot;\n\n**Rationale for Proposed Change:**\n\n1.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Addresses Intangible Nature:** Explicitly acknowledges that &quot;well-defined&quot; for intangibles means defining functional and technical specifications, not physical ones, making the standard applicable to modern assets like software.</span> <span class=\"addition\">2.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Provides Clarity:** Gives concrete examples of how intangible assets can be defined (functional specs, architecture, performance, acceptance criteria), reducing ambiguity for practitioners.</span> <span class=\"addition\">3.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Accommodates Complexity:** Recognizes the complexity and iterative nature of software development, particularly AI, by allowing for phased definitions and acknowledging that specifications might be refined, provided the initial scope is clear and changes are managed formally.</span> <span class=\"addition\">4.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Maintains Shariah Principle:** Reinforces that despite complexity, the definition must be sufficient to eliminate excessive Gharar at contract inception and for any subsequent modifications.</span> <span class=\"addition\">5.</span> <span class=\"addition\">**Facilitates Application:** Makes it practical for financial institutions and developers to structure Istisna&#x27;a contracts for software and other complex intangible assets in compliance with Shariah.</span> <span class=\"addition\">---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 2: Clarifying &quot;Determination of Cost/Price&quot;
