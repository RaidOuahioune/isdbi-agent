    "review": "Okay, Standards Reviewer Agent reporting for duty. Let's analyze AAOIFI FAS 10 (Istisna'a) in the context of structuring a contract for a large-scale AI software platform development.\n\nAAOIFI FAS 10 sets the standards for Istisna'a contracts, which are essentially manufacturing or construction contracts where a party undertakes to produce a specific item according to agreed-upon specifications. While traditionally applied to tangible assets (buildings, machinery, etc.), the application to intangible assets like software raises specific challenges.\n\nBased on the scenario and the typical requirements of FAS 10, here are the key areas needing enhancement when dealing with complex software development:\n\n**Analysis of AAOIFI FAS 10 for Software Development Scenario:**\n\n1.  **Specific Section/Clause:** Requirements regarding the *description of the subject matter* (Mau\u1e63\u016bf f\u012b al-dhimmah).\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** FAS 10 typically requires the subject matter of the Istisna'a to be \"well-defined\" and described in sufficient detail to eliminate ambiguity regarding its nature, type, quality, and specifications. While the standard generally allows for specifications to be agreed upon, the level of detail expected is often framed in the context of tangible goods or construction, where physical attributes and quantities are central. It may not explicitly address the unique challenges of defining complex, evolving intangible assets like large-scale AI software. Software specifications, especially for innovative AI systems, can be highly complex, interconnected, and subject to change as development progresses or new insights emerge. Defining the *exact* final features, performance metrics, and technical architecture upfront with the precision expected for a tangible asset can be impractical or impossible.\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** For a \"large-scale AI software platform,\" the final form, features, and even the exact technical specifications might not be fully known or fixed at the contract's inception. AI development often involves iterative processes, research, and adaptation based on preliminary results. Requiring a static, perfectly \"well-defined\" description from day one can make structuring the contract difficult or force parties into rigid specifications that hinder necessary flexibility and innovation inherent in complex software projects. It creates uncertainty on whether the contract truly meets the \"well-defined\" requirement if the specifications are expected to evolve significantly.\n\n2.  **Specific Section/Clause:** Requirements regarding the *determination of the cost/price* (Tham\u0101n).\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** FAS 10 generally requires the price of the Istisna'a subject matter to be fixed and known at the time of contracting. While provisions for stage payments are typically allowed, the total price is usually expected to be determined upfront. The standard may not adequately address mechanisms for handling potential cost variations that are common in complex software development projects due to unforeseen technical challenges, changes in scope (even if minor but impactful), or fluctuations in necessary resources (e.g., specialized expertise, computing power).\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** The cost of developing a \"large-scale AI software platform\" can be highly unpredictable. Factors like the complexity of algorithms, required data processing capabilities, integration challenges with existing systems, and the need for extensive testing and refinement can lead to significant cost overruns compared to initial estimates. A strict requirement for a fixed price upfront might place undue risk on the manufacturer (developer) or lead to inflated initial quotes to cover potential risks, making the project potentially unfeasible or commercially unattractive. The standard lacks explicit guidance on how to structure pricing models (e.g., cost-plus with a cap, phased pricing linked to milestones with some flexibility) that align with the dynamic cost nature of complex software while remaining Shariah-compliant within the Istisna'a framework.\n\n3.  **Specific Section/Clause:** Implicit assumptions within the standard regarding the *nature of the deliverable*.\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** While not a single clause, the overall framing of FAS 10 often implicitly assumes a tangible, physical output that is \"manufactured\" or \"constructed.\" The language and examples typically relate to physical goods or buildings. It may not explicitly clarify how concepts like \"delivery\" (e.g., deployment, access licenses), \"defects\" (e.g., bugs, performance issues, security vulnerabilities), or \"quality control\" apply specifically to intangible software, which exists as code, data, and functionality, not a physical object.\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** Applying terms designed for tangible goods to intangible software can create interpretive challenges. How is \"delivery\" defined for a cloud-based platform? What constitutes a \"defect\" in AI software (e.g., bias, inaccurate predictions, performance degradation)? How are \"materials\" accounted for (e.g., third-party libraries, open-source components, proprietary algorithms)? The standard lacks specific guidance or examples tailored to intangible assets, leaving room for ambiguity in contractual terms and potentially differing interpretations of compliance.\n\n**Areas Needing Enhancement:**\n\nTo better address scenarios like the AI software platform development, AAOIFI FAS 10 could be enhanced by:\n\n*   Adding specific guidance or an appendix addressing the application of Istisna'a to intangible assets, particularly complex software development.\n*   Clarifying how the \"well-defined subject matter\" requirement applies to software, potentially allowing for specifications to be defined in phases or allowing for a degree of flexibility/evolution within agreed parameters, provided the core objective remains clear.\n*   Providing clearer guidance on permissible pricing structures for complex projects with inherent cost uncertainty, potentially exploring mechanisms like target cost with incentives, or phased pricing linked to verifiable milestones and scope definitions, while ensuring the fundamental principle of price determination at contract remains upheld in a Shariah-compliant manner.\n*   Including definitions and guidance specific to software development contexts, such as defining \"delivery\" (e.g., deployment, source code escrow, access rights), \"defects\" (e.g., bug severity levels, performance criteria), and \"materials\" (e.g., licenses, underlying technologies) within the Istisna'a framework.\n*   Providing case studies or examples illustrating how Istisna'a can be structured for technological projects involving intangible deliverables.\n\nThese enhancements would provide much-needed clarity and flexibility, making Istisna'a a more practical and less uncertain structure for financing and undertaking complex software development projects like the AI platform described.",

While traditionally applied to tangible assets (buildings, machinery, etc.), the application to intangible assets like software raises specific challenges.\n\nBased on the scenario and the typical requirements of FAS 10, here are the key areas needing enhancement when dealing with complex software development:\n\n**Analysis of AAOIFI FAS 10 for Software Development Scenario:**\n\n1.  **Specific Section/Clause:** Requirements regarding the *description of the subject matter* (Mau\u1e63\u016bf f\u012b al-dhimmah).\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** FAS 10 typically requires the subject matter of the Istisna'a to be \"well-defined\" and described in sufficient detail to eliminate ambiguity regarding its nature, type, quality, and specifications. While the standard generally allows for specifications to be agreed upon, the level of detail expected is often framed in the context of tangible goods or construction, where physical attributes and quantities are central. It may not explicitly address the unique challenges of defining complex, evolving intangible assets like large-scale AI software. Software specifications, especially for innovative AI systems, can be highly complex, interconnected, and subject to change as development progresses or new insights emerge. Defining the *exact* final features, performance metrics, and technical architecture upfront with the precision expected for a tangible asset can be impractical or impossible.\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** For a \"large-scale AI software platform,\" the final form, features, and even the exact technical specifications might not be fully known or fixed at the contract's inception. AI development often involves iterative processes, research, and adaptation based on preliminary results. Requiring a static, perfectly \"well-defined\" description from day one can make structuring the contract difficult or force parties into rigid specifications that hinder necessary flexibility and innovation inherent in complex software projects. It creates uncertainty on whether the contract truly meets the \"well-defined\" requirement if the specifications are expected to evolve significantly.\n\n2.  **Specific Section/Clause:** Requirements regarding the *determination of the cost/price* (Tham\u0101n).\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** FAS 10 generally requires the price of the Istisna'a subject matter to be fixed and known at the time of contracting. While provisions for stage payments are typically allowed, the total price is usually expected to be determined upfront. The standard may not adequately address mechanisms for handling potential cost variations that are common in complex software development projects due to unforeseen technical challenges, changes in scope (even if minor but impactful), or fluctuations in necessary resources (e.g., specialized expertise, computing power).\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** The cost of developing a \"large-scale AI software platform\" can be highly unpredictable. Factors like the complexity of algorithms, required data processing capabilities, integration challenges with existing systems, and the need for extensive testing and refinement can lead to significant cost overruns compared to initial estimates. A strict requirement for a fixed price upfront might place undue risk on the manufacturer (developer) or lead to inflated initial quotes to cover potential risks, making the project potentially unfeasible or commercially unattractive. The standard lacks explicit guidance on how to structure pricing models (e.g., cost-plus with a cap, phased pricing linked to milestones with some flexibility) that align with the dynamic cost nature of complex software while remaining Shariah-compliant within the Istisna'a framework.\n\n3.  **Specific Section/Clause:** Implicit assumptions within the standard regarding the *nature of the deliverable*.\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** While not a single clause, the overall framing of FAS 10 often implicitly assumes a tangible, physical output that is \"manufactured\" or \"constructed.\" The language and examples typically relate to physical goods or buildings. It may not explicitly clarify how concepts like \"delivery\" (e.g., deployment, access licenses), \"defects\" (e.g., bugs, performance issues, security vulnerabilities), or \"quality control\" apply specifically to intangible software, which exists as code, data, and functionality, not a physical object.\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** Applying terms designed for tangible goods to intangible software can create interpretive challenges. How is \"delivery\" defined for a cloud-based platform? What constitutes a \"defect\" in AI software (e.g., bias, inaccurate predictions, performance degradation)? How are \"materials\" accounted for (e.g., third-party libraries, open-source components, proprietary algorithms)? The standard lacks specific guidance or examples tailored to intangible assets, leaving room for ambiguity in contractual terms and potentially differing interpretations of compliance.\n\n**Areas Needing Enhancement:**\n\nTo better address scenarios like the AI software platform development, AAOIFI FAS 10 could be enhanced by:\n\n*   Adding specific guidance or an appendix addressing the application of Istisna'a to intangible assets, particularly complex software development.\n*   Clarifying how the \"well-defined subject matter\" requirement applies to software, potentially allowing for specifications to be defined in phases or allowing for a degree of flexibility/evolution within agreed parameters, provided the core objective remains clear.\n*   Providing clearer guidance on permissible pricing structures for complex projects with inherent cost uncertainty, potentially exploring mechanisms like target cost with incentives, or phased pricing linked to verifiable milestones and scope definitions, while ensuring the fundamental principle of price determination at contract remains upheld in a Shariah-compliant manner.\n*   Including definitions and guidance specific to software development contexts, such as defining \"delivery\" (e.g., deployment, source code escrow, access rights), \"defects\" (e.g., bug severity levels, performance criteria), and \"materials\" (e.g., licenses, underlying technologies) within the Istisna'a framework.\n*   Providing case studies or examples illustrating how Istisna'a can be structured for technological projects involving intangible deliverables.\n\nThese enhancements would provide much-needed clarity and flexibility, making Istisna'a a more practical and less uncertain structure for financing and undertaking complex software development projects like the AI platform described.",

      "validation_result": "Okay, Standards Validator Agent. I will now validate the proposed enhancement to AAOIFI FAS 10 against the specified criteria.\n\n**Proposed Enhancement Summary:**\nThe proposal suggests adding a new section or appendix to FAS 10 to provide specific guidance for applying Istisna'a contracts to intangible assets, particularly complex software development. The key areas addressed are:\n1.  **Subject Matter Definition:** Clarifying how \"well-defined subject matter\" applies to software, allowing for phased specifications within a clear overall scope, purpose, and agreed methodology/acceptance criteria.\n2.  **Price Determination:** Providing guidance on permissible pricing mechanisms for complex intangible projects beyond just a fixed lump-sum, including milestone-based calculation, cost-plus with a cap, or other unambiguous calculation methods.\n3.  **Key Terminology:** Defining terms like \"Delivery,\" \"Defects,\" and \"Materials\" in the context of software development.\n\n**Validation Checks:**\n\n1.  **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n    *   **Core Islamic Finance Principles:**\n        *   *Prohibition of Riba (Interest):* The proposed pricing mechanisms (fixed, milestone-based calculation, capped cost-plus) define the total price or its method of calculation upfront. None introduce interest-based returns or calculations. **Compliant.**\n        *   *Prohibition of Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty):*\n            *   Proposal 1 directly addresses Gharar regarding the subject matter by acknowledging that detailed specifications for complex software may evolve. However, it mitigates this by requiring clarity on the *core purpose, key functionalities, overall scope*, and crucially, the *methodology, acceptance criteria, and mechanisms for managing specification evolution*. This ensures the fundamental nature and objective are known, and the process for defining details is clear, significantly reducing the Gharar that would arise from vague terms or undefined processes. This is a reasonable adaptation of the \"well-defined\" principle for the nature of intangible assets. **Compliant.**\n            *   Proposal 2 addresses Gharar regarding the price. Shariah requires the price or its method of determination to be known at contracting to avoid price uncertainty (Gharar). While a fixed price is ideal, the proposal allows for methods where the final price is calculable based on agreed terms (milestones, capped costs, defined metrics). A capped cost-plus ensures the *maximum* price is known. Milestone-based pricing requires the calculation method tied to milestones to be clear. As long as the *method* for determining the final price is unambiguous at contract inception, this avoids Gharar in the price. This aligns with the flexibility in Istisna'a pricing (allowing deferred/installment payments where the total is known) noted in the FAS 10 vs Salam comparison. **Compliant.**\n            *   Proposal 3 reduces operational Gharar by providing specific definitions for terms like \"Delivery,\" \"Defects,\" and \"Materials\" as they apply to software. This ensures clarity on what constitutes completion, acceptable quality, and project inputs. **Compliant.**\n        *   *Prohibition of Maysir (Gambling):* The proposals do not introduce elements of gambling or pure speculation. The contract remains tied to the production of a specific, albeit intangible, asset. **Compliant.**\n        *   *Asset-Backing:* The subject matter remains the software platform, which is the asset being manufactured/developed under the Istisna'a contract. This principle is maintained. **Compliant.**\n        *   *Risk-Sharing:* Istisna'a is a manufacturing contract where the manufacturer (Sani') generally bears the risk of production costs exceeding the contract price. The proposed pricing models (fixed, capped cost-plus) maintain this risk structure for the Sani' regarding costs relative to the agreed price/cap. **Compliant.**\n        *   *Ethical Investment:* The proposals focus on contract structure, not the nature of the AI software itself. Assuming the AI software's purpose is Shariah-compliant, the proposals do not introduce ethical issues. **Compliant (subject to the specific asset's nature).**\n        *   *Transparency and Fairness:* By reducing ambiguity in subject matter, price determination, and key terms, the proposals enhance transparency and fairness for both parties. **Compliant.**\n    *   **FAS 10 Specific Principles:**\n        *   *Specification of Subject Matter:* Proposal 1 adapts the strict \"kind, type, quality, quantity\" approach (FAS 10 Para 4/1/1) for intangibles by focusing on purpose, scope, and a defined process for specification. This is a necessary and Shariah-compliant interpretation for assets that evolve during production, aligning with the need to remove \"any lack of knowledge\" by clearly defining *how* the subject matter will be specified and verified. **Compliant with underlying principle.**\n        *   *Fixed Price:* Proposal 2 interprets the requirement for a fixed price by allowing methods where the *method of calculation* is fixed and known upfront. This aligns with the Shariah principle of avoiding price Gharar and is a valid application of the requirement that the price *or its method of determination* is known. This is consistent with the flexibility noted in the FAS 10 comparison with Salam. **Compliant with underlying principle.**\n        *   *Delivery Terms:* Proposal 3 clarifies delivery for software, supporting this requirement. **Compliant.**\n        *   *Liability and Risk:* Proposal 3's definition of defects supports the Sani's liability for non-conformity. **Consistent.**\n\n2.  **Consistency Check:**\n    *   **Internal Consistency within FAS 10:** The proposals do not contradict existing clauses but rather provide necessary interpretation and application guidance for a new asset class (intangibles/software). They build upon the core principles (subject matter definition, price determination) by demonstrating how they can be applied practically and Shariah-compliantly to software development, which differs significantly from manufacturing tangible goods or constructing buildings. Adding a dedicated section or appendix is a standard method for providing such specific guidance within a standard. **Consistent.**\n    *   **Consistency with other related standards:** The context provided from FAS 4 (Musharaka) and FAS 7 (Salam) indicates that AAOIFI standards already accommodate intangible assets and require clear valuation/definition when they are part of a contract (e.g., as capital in Musharaka or Salam). The proposed enhancements for FAS 10 align with this broader approach of adapting standard principles to the nature of the asset involved, including intangibles. **Consistent.**\n\n3.  **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n    *   The challenges identified (defining complex software, predicting costs) are real issues in software development projects.\n    *   The proposed solutions (phased specifications within a clear scope, milestone-based payments, capped cost-plus) are standard, well-understood contractual mechanisms used in the software development industry.\n    *   Providing explicit guidance within the standard on how to structure these elements in a Shariah-compliant Istisna'a contract makes the standard highly practical and applicable to modern technology projects. It empowers financial institutions and developers to use Istisna'a for software, reducing uncertainty and the need for *ad hoc* interpretations. **Highly Practical.**\n\n4.  **Final Decision:**\n\n**APPROVED.**\n\n**Detailed Reasoning:**\n\nThe proposed enhancements provide essential clarity and practical guidance for applying AAOIFI FAS 10 to intangible assets like complex software development, which are currently challenging to structure under the standard's existing wording primarily framed for tangible assets.\n\n1.  **Shariah Compliance:** The proposals are fundamentally Shariah-compliant. They do not introduce Riba, Maysir, or violate asset-backing principles. Crucially, they effectively address the potential for Gharar (excessive uncertainty) inherent in complex, evolving intangible projects. Proposal 1 manages subject matter Gharar by requiring clarity on the core scope and the *process* for defining specifications. Proposal 2 manages price Gharar by allowing clearly defined *methods* of price calculation (milestone-based, capped cost-plus) alongside the fixed price option, ensuring the price or its calculation method is known upfront. Proposal 3 reduces operational Gharar through specific definitions for software terms. These adaptations are necessary and permissible applications of Shariah principles to a new context.\n2.  **Consistency:** The proposals maintain consistency with the core principles of FAS 10. They do not abolish the requirements for subject matter specification or price determination but provide valid interpretations for how these requirements apply to intangible assets that differ in nature from tangible goods or construction projects. The proposed structure (a new section/appendix) is a standard way to incorporate such specific guidance. Consistency with other standards (FAS 4, FAS 7) dealing with intangible assets is also maintained.\n3.  **Practical Implementation:** The proposed guidance directly addresses the practical difficulties faced by financial institutions and developers when applying Istisna'a to software. The suggested approaches for defining scope, handling evolving specifications, and determining price (milestone-based, capped cost-plus) are standard and practical methods used in the software industry. Codifying these within the standard provides much-needed certainty and facilitates the use of Istisna'a for financing technological projects.\n\nThe proposed enhancements are a necessary and well-reasoned evolution of FAS 10 to remain relevant in a changing economy where intangible assets are increasingly significant. They provide the necessary flexibility while upholding core Shariah principles and maintaining consistency within the AAOIFI framework."

      "inline_diff_html": "<span class=\"deletion\">Dr. Abdul Sattar Abughoddah\n</span><span class=\"addition\">Okay, Standards Enhancement Proposer Agent initiating proposal based on the Reviewer&#x27;s analysis of AAOIFI FAS </span>10<span class=\"deletion\">.</span><span class=\"addition\"> and the AI software development scenario.\n\nGiven that the provided &quot;Original Text&quot; is minimal (only the author&#x27;s name), I will base the proposed enhancements on the *analysis* of the standard&#x27;s typical requirements as described by the reviewer, rather than modifying specific clauses I don&#x27;t have. My proposal will focus on adding clarity and specific guidance relevant to intangible assets like software, likely within new or expanded sections of the standard.\n\n---\n\n**Proposed Enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 (Istisna&#x27;a)**\n\n**General Approach:** Introduce a new section or appendix within FAS 10 specifically addressing the application of Istisna&#x27;a contracts to intangible assets, with a focus on complex software development. This section would clarify how the standard&#x27;s core principles apply in this context.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 1: Clarifying Subject Matter Definition for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Area Addressed:** Requirements regarding the description of the subject matter (Mau\u1e63\u016bf f\u012b al-dhimmah).\n*   **Issue Identified (from analysis):** The requirement for a &quot;well-defined&quot; subject matter is challenging for complex, evolving intangible assets like large-scale software, where specifications may develop over time.\n*   **Rationale for Change:** The current requirement, typically framed for tangible goods, creates ambiguity for software projects where iterative development and phased specification definition are common. Clarifying this principle will enable parties to structure Istisna&#x27;a contracts for software while maintaining Shariah compliance by ensuring the core objective and scope are clear from the outset, even if detailed technical specifications evolve within defined parameters.\n\n*   **Assumed Current Principle (based on analysis):** The subject matter must be &quot;well-defined&quot; and described in sufficient detail to eliminate ambiguity regarding its nature, type, quality, and specifications at the time of contracting.\n*   **Proposed New Text (to be added under a new section, e.g., &quot;Application of Istisna&#x27;a to Intangible Assets&quot;):**\n\n    ```\n    **[New Clause/Section Header: Subject Matter of Intangible Assets]**\n\n    When the subject matter of the Istisna&#x27;a contract is an intangible asset, such as software, the requirement for the subject matter to be well-defined necessitates a clear articulation of its core purpose, key functionalities, performance objectives, and the overall scope of the project at the time of contracting. While detailed technical specifications and features may be agreed upon in phases tied to verifiable project milestones, the initial contract must establish clear parameters for the development process, including the methodology, acceptance criteria for each phase, and mechanisms for managing specification evolution within the agreed overall scope. This ensures that the fundamental nature and objective of the subject matter, as well as the process for its definition, remain unambiguous and agreed upon by all parties from the contract&#x27;s inception.\n    ```\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 2: Guidance on Price Determination for Complex Intangible Projects**\n\n*   **Area Addressed:** Requirements regarding the determination of the cost/price (Tham\u0101n).\n*   **Issue Identified (from analysis):** The requirement for a fixed price upfront is difficult for complex software development projects with inherent cost uncertainty due to unforeseen technical challenges or evolving requirements.\n*   **Rationale for Change:** The dynamic nature of complex software development makes precise upfront cost estimation challenging. Providing guidance on permissible pricing mechanisms that accommodate this uncertainty, while still adhering to the Shariah requirement for the price or its method of determination to be known at contracting, will make Istisna&#x27;a a more practical tool for financing such projects. This avoids undue risk on either party or inflated initial pricing.\n\n*   **Assumed Current Principle (based on analysis):** The price of the Istisna&#x27;a subject matter must be fixed and known at the time of contracting, although payment can be structured in instalments.\n*   **Proposed New Text (to be added under the new section &quot;Application of Istisna&#x27;a to Intangible Assets&quot; or a dedicated pricing sub-section):**\n\n    ```\n    **[New Clause/Section Header: Price Determination for Complex Intangible Projects]**\n\n    For Istisna&#x27;a contracts involving complex intangible assets like software development, where precise cost estimation upfront may be subject to greater uncertainty than tangible assets, the price must nonetheless be clearly determined at the time of contracting. This determination may take the form of:\n    a) A fixed lump-sum price agreed upfront.\n    b) A clearly defined mechanism for price calculation linked to verifiable project milestones and the successful delivery of specific, agreed-upon functionalities or phases.\n    c) A cost-plus arrangement with a pre-agreed and fixed maximum price (cap), where the final price is the lower of the actual verifiable costs of production (as defined in the contract) or the agreed maximum price.\n    d) Any other mechanism where the method for calculating the final price is unambiguous and agreed upon by all parties at the contract inception, ensuring price certainty through definition of the calculation method, even if the final amount is subject to calculation based on agreed metrics, scope, or capped costs.\n    The contract must clearly define how costs are calculated and verified in mechanisms (b) and (c).\n    ```\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 3: Clarifying Key Terms for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Area Addressed:** Implicit assumptions within the standard regarding the nature of the deliverable (tangible vs. intangible).\n*   **Issue Identified (from analysis):** Terms like &quot;delivery,&quot; &quot;defects,&quot; and &quot;materials,&quot; typically framed for tangible goods, lack specific clarity when applied to intangible assets like software.\n*   **Rationale for Change:** Providing definitions and guidance specific to intangible assets will reduce ambiguity in contract drafting and interpretation for software Istisna&#x27;a. This ensures that the operational aspects of the contract (what constitutes completion, what is considered a problem, what inputs are involved) are clearly understood and aligned with the nature of software development.\n\n*   **Assumed Current Framing (based on analysis):** Standard language and examples often implicitly assume a physical, tangible output.\n*   **Proposed New Text (to be added under the new section &quot;Application of Istisna&#x27;a to Intangible Assets&quot;):**\n\n    ```\n    **[New Clause/Section Header: Definitions and Application for Intangible Assets]**\n\n    When the subject matter of the Istisna&#x27;a is an intangible asset like software, the contract terms related to its development and completion shall be defined in a manner appropriate to the asset&#x27;s nature. The contract must clearly define:\n    a)  **&#x27;Delivery&#x27;**: This may be defined in terms of successful deployment to a specified environment, provision of access rights to a platform, escrow of source code, provision of necessary licenses, or other mutually agreed mechanisms indicating the software&#x27;s readiness for use or testing according to agreed specifications and milestones.\n    b)  **&#x27;Defects&#x27;**: These shall be defined based on agreed performance criteria, deviations from specified functionalities, security vulnerabilities, or programming errors (bugs) that prevent the software from meeting the agreed specifications or intended purpose. The contract may categorise defects (e.g., by severity level) and define corresponding rectification obligations and timelines.\n    c)  **&#x27;Materials&#x27;**: This may encompass the necessary inputs for software development which are consumed or incorporated into the final product, including but not limited to, software licenses, third-party components, necessary data sets for training or operation, access to required computing resources (e.g., cloud services), and the specialised expertise (human capital) required for development.
