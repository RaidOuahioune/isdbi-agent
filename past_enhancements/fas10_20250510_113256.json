    "review": "Okay, as the Standards Reviewer Agent, I will analyze AAOIFI FAS 10 based on your trigger scenario regarding an Istisna'a contract for a large-scale AI software platform.\n\nThe trigger scenario highlights challenges with applying FAS 10's requirements for 'well-defined subject matter' and 'determination of cost' to intangible, R&D-heavy projects like AI software development.\n\nHere are the findings based on the provided text of FAS 10:\n\n**1. Specific Section/Clause:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules, para 4. Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a, specifically 4/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019, and 4/1/1 (requiring Al-Masnoo\u2019 to be known and specified in terms of kind, type, quality, and quantity). Also Appendix (C), para 2 Definition and Appendix (F) Definitions, Istisna\u2019a, which define the subject matter as \"Al-Masnoo' (the subject matter of the contract) according to the specifications\". Appendix C, para 3(7) footnote states \"The subject matter may be a commodity, service or both.\"\n\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** While footnote (7) acknowledges that the subject matter can be a \"service or both,\" the detailed requirements in 4/1/1 (kind, type, quality, quantity) and the general framing of Al-Masnoo' throughout the standard (e.g., mentioning \"manufacturing\" repeatedly) are heavily oriented towards tangible goods or more standardized services (like construction). Defining \"kind,\" \"type,\" \"quality,\" and \"quantity\" precisely for a complex, large-scale AI software platform at the outset of the contract is inherently difficult. Software quality (performance, reliability, scalability, accuracy of AI models) and quantity (feature sets, data handling capacity) can be hard to specify exhaustively and immutably from the beginning.\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** AI software development often involves significant research, experimentation, and iterative refinement. The final \"quality\" and \"quantity\" of the platform may evolve based on testing, data availability, and user feedback during the development process. The standard's requirement for a precisely \"known and specified\" subject matter upfront poses a challenge for structuring Istisna'a for projects where the exact outcome and specifications are subject to discovery and change, creating uncertainty about contract validity and the basis for measuring progress.\n\n**2. Specific Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, para 2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs, specifically point (I) defining Direct costs and the explicit exclusion: \"General and admin-istrative expenses, selling expenses, **research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs**.\" Also Appendix (F) Definitions: Istisna\u2019a Work-in-Progress Account, Istisna\u2019a Costs Account, which accumulate \"Istisna'a contract costs\".\n\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** The standard explicitly excludes \"research and development costs\" from Istisna'a contract costs. In the context of developing novel or large-scale AI software, a substantial, perhaps even primary, component of the development effort *is* research and development. This includes activities like algorithm selection and tuning, data model training, creating novel functionalities, and resolving complex technical challenges that haven't been solved before. The line between \"producing Al-Masnoo'\" and \"research and development\" is often blurred or non-existent in cutting-edge software development, particularly AI.\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** If significant portions of the AI software development costs are classified as \"research and development\" and thus excluded from Istisna'a costs according to para 2/1, the accumulated \"Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress account\" or \"Istisna\u2019a costs account\" will not reflect the true economic cost incurred in developing the asset. This undermines the basis for applying the percentage-of-completion method (which relies on measuring progress based on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs) and misrepresents the asset value being created on the balance sheet. The standard's cost definition seems incompatible with the cost structure of modern, R&D-heavy software projects like AI platforms.\n\n**3. Specific Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, para 2/3/1/1 Percentage of completion method and Appendix (E) Basis for Conclusions, Recognition of Istisna\u2019a Profit, point (a) which states that a crucial condition for applying this method is that \"the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy.\"\n\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** The preferred accounting method for profit recognition (percentage-of-completion) relies heavily on the ability to estimate the total cost of the contract with \"reasonable accuracy.\"\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** As mentioned, large-scale AI software development projects often involve significant technical uncertainty and R&D. Predicting the exact time and resources required to overcome challenges, optimize performance, and finalize features makes estimating the *total* cost with \"reasonable accuracy\" very difficult. This forces the use of the less preferred completed-contract method, delaying profit recognition until completion, which may not accurately reflect the economic substance of the ongoing development work and could impact financial reporting and profit distribution to stakeholders.\n\n**4. Specific Section/Clause:** Appendix (F) Definitions: Change Orders, Additional Claims. Statement of the Standard, para 2/5 Change orders and additional claims.\n\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** The standard provides a framework for handling changes and additional claims. \"Change Orders\" are \"Approved modifications in the specifications... which affects the contract costs.\" \"Additional Claims\" are for amounts in excess of the price for causes like delays, errors, or \"other causes of unanticipated costs caused by Al-Mustasni\u2019,\" requiring a legal basis and unforeseeable circumstances \"not the result of the deficiencies, fault or negligence of Al-Sani\u2019.\"\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** Iterative development, common in software and essential for AI, involves frequent adjustments and refinements that may not always fit the formal process implied by \"Approved modifications\" or \"Change Orders\" designed for physical construction. Furthermore, the \"unforeseen circumstances\" leading to cost overruns in AI development are often inherent technical challenges or discoveries during the R&D process, not necessarily caused by Al-Mustasni' or clearly distinct from Al-Sani's \"deficiencies\" (e.g., inability to predict R&D outcomes). The standard's framework seems less suited to the dynamic and exploratory nature of AI development projects.\n\nIn summary, while FAS 10's flexibility in allowing Istisna'a for services helps, its roots in tangible manufacturing and the explicit exclusion of R&D costs pose significant challenges for applying it effectively to complex, R&D-heavy intangible assets like AI software platforms. The requirements for upfront specification and reliable cost estimation are also difficult to meet in this context.",
    "proposal": "Okay, Standards Enhancement Proposer Agent reporting for duty. Based on the reviewer's findings regarding AAOIFI FAS 10 and its application to an Istisna'a contract for an AI software platform, here are the proposed enhancements:\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 1: Clarifying the Definition of Al-Masnoo' for Intangible Assets**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The standard's description of Al-Masnoo', particularly the requirements in Appendix C, para 4/1/1 (kind, type, quality, quantity), is heavily geared towards tangible goods, creating ambiguity when the subject matter is a complex, evolving intangible asset like AI software. While footnote (7) mentions services, the main text lacks detail on how specifications apply to non-physical items.\n\n**Original Text (Relevant Snippets):**\n\n*   **Appendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a**\n    *   **2.

Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a**\n        *   **4/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019**\n            *   **4/1/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019 must be known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its:**\n                *   a) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.;\n                *   b) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.;\n                *   c) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications; and\n                *   d) Quantity.\n\n*   **Appendix (F) Definitions**\n    *   **Istisna\u2019a**\n        *   It is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 , (the seller) whereby Al-Sani\u2019 - based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured or otherwise acquire **Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract) according to the specifications** and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement...\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n*   **Appendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a**\n    *   **2. Definition**\n        *   Istisna\u2019a is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller), whereby Al-Sani\u2019- based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured or otherwise acquired **Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract), which can be tangible, intangible, or a combination thereof, according to the specifications** and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement...\n    *   **(7)** The subject matter may be a commodity, service, intangible asset, or a combination thereof.\n    *   **4. Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a**\n        *   **4/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019**\n            *   **4/1/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019 must be known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its essential characteristics and scope. For tangible assets, this includes specification of its:**\n                *   a) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.;\n                *   b) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.;\n                *   c) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications; and\n                *   d) Quantity.\n            *   **For intangible assets, specifications shall focus on defining the required functionalities, performance parameters, technical requirements, scope, and other relevant attributes necessary to clearly identify the subject matter and its intended outcome.**\n\n*   **Appendix (F) Definitions**\n    *   **Istisna\u2019a**\n        *   It is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 , (the seller) whereby Al-Sani\u2019 - based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured or otherwise acquire **Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract), which can be tangible, intangible, or a combination thereof, according to the specifications** and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement...\n\n**Rationale for Change:**\nThe original text, while implicitly allowing services (footnote 7), does not provide clear guidance on how the fundamental requirement of specifying Al-Masnoo' applies to intangible assets. The proposed changes explicitly include intangible assets in the definition and provide a framework for specifying them based on functional, performance, and scope characteristics, which are the relevant attributes for software and similar intangible products, rather than physical kind, type, quality, and quantity. This aligns the standard with modern economic activities and ensures Shari'ah compliance by maintaining the requirement for clearly defined subject matter, adapted for the nature of intangible assets.\n\n**How it Addresses the Trigger Scenario:**\nThis change directly addresses the uncertainty in specifying a large-scale AI software platform. Instead of trying to shoehorn software into categories like \"kind\" or \"quantity\" in a physical sense, the standard would explicitly permit specification based on functionalities (e.g., natural language processing, image recognition), performance metrics (e.g., accuracy rate, processing speed), technical architecture, and the overall scope of the platform. This provides a clearer basis for contract validity and measurement of progress for intangible assets.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 2: Inclusion of Directly Related R&D Costs in Istisna'a Costs**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The explicit exclusion of \"research and development costs\" from Istisna'a contract costs in Statement of the Standard, para 2/1, contradicts the nature of Istisna'a when the contract *is* for the creation of a novel asset where R&D is an integral part of the production process, as is common in AI software development.\n\n**Original Text (Relevant Snippet):**\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)**\n        *   **2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs**\n            *   a) Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and admin-istrative expenses, selling expenses, **research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs.**\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)**\n        *   **2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs**\n            *   a) Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs directly and specifically related to the production or creation of Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating directly to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. **Research and development costs that are integral and specific to the creation of the contracted Al-Masnoo\u2019 shall be included in Istisna\u2019a contract costs.** General and administrative expenses and selling expenses shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs.\n\n**Rationale for Change:**\nThe original exclusion of R&D costs appears to be based on a model where R&D is a general corporate activity. However, in an Istisna'a contract for a novel or complex item like custom software or an AI platform, the R&D required to achieve the contracted specifications *is* the cost of producing that specific item. Excluding these costs misrepresents the total investment in creating Al-Masnoo' and undermines the basis for profit recognition methods like percentage-of-completion. The proposed change distinguishes between general R&D and R&D specifically undertaken as part of the Istisna'a production process, allowing the latter to be capitalized as contract costs, which is consistent with the economic reality of creating a tailored asset under Istisna'a.\n\n**How it Addresses the Trigger Scenario:**\nThis is crucial for the AI software platform scenario. Development of such a platform involves significant R&D (algorithm selection, model training, novel feature development). Under the original standard, these costs would likely be expensed, leading to an under-recognition of the asset being built and distorting the financial performance reported under Istisna'a. The proposed change allows these integral R&D costs to be properly included in the Istisna'a work-in-progress, providing a more accurate reflection of the asset's cost and enabling proper application of revenue recognition methods.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 3: Guidance on Cost Estimation for Complex/Intangible Assets**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The preferred percentage-of-completion method requires \"reasonable accuracy\" in estimating total contract costs (para 2/3/1/1, Appendix E). This is inherently difficult for complex, R&D-heavy projects like AI software development where technical uncertainties exist.\n\n**Original Text (Relevant Snippet):**\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2/3/1/1 Percentage of completion method**\n        *   ...A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy. (para. 8, 9)\n*   **Appendix (E) Basis for Conclusions**\n    *   **Recognition of Istisna\u2019a Profit**\n        *   ...A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy.\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2/3/1/1 Percentage of completion method**\n        *   ...A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy. **For contracts involving complex or intangible assets, particularly those with significant integrated research and development components, achieving reasonable accuracy in cost estimation may require the use of robust project management methodologies, iterative estimation processes, and frequent review and revision of estimates as the project progresses and uncertainties are resolved.**\n*   **Appendix (E) Basis for Conclusions**\n    *   **Recognition of Istisna\u2019a Profit**\n        *   ...A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy. **The assessment of whether reasonable accuracy can be achieved should consider the nature and complexity of the Al-Masnoo', including whether it involves significant integrated research and development. For such complex projects, robust estimation techniques and processes for frequent estimate revisions are expected.**\n\n**Rationale for Change:**\nThe standard correctly identifies reliable cost estimation as key to the percentage-of-completion method. However, it doesn't acknowledge the varying degrees of difficulty in achieving this based on project type. By adding guidance specific to complex or R&D-heavy intangible assets, the standard provides direction on *how* to approach estimation in these cases, implicitly recognizing that while challenging, it may still be possible to achieve \"reasonable accuracy\" through appropriate project management and estimation practices. This encourages the use of the preferred method where feasible, even for complex projects, rather than defaulting to the completed-contract method solely due to perceived estimation difficulty without guidance.\n\n**How it Addresses the Trigger Scenario:**\nThis addresses the challenge of estimating costs for the AI platform. The proposed text acknowledges that estimating costs for AI development is complex but suggests that employing specific techniques (like iterative refinement, frequent reviews) can help achieve the necessary \"reasonable accuracy.\" This provides a pathway for financial institutions to potentially use the percentage-of-completion method for such contracts, reflecting the economic substance of the ongoing development work and allowing for timely profit recognition.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 4: Adapting Change Order and Additional Claim Framework for Iterative Development**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The framework for Change Orders and Additional Claims (Appendix F Definitions, Statement of the Standard, para 2/5) seems more suited to fixed-scope construction/manufacturing and may not adequately capture the iterative nature of software development or cost impacts from unforeseen technical *discoveries* inherent in R&D, rather than just external factors or Al-Mustasni's actions.\n\n**Original Text (Relevant Snippets):**\n\n*   **Appendix (F) Definitions**\n    *   **Change Orders**\n        *   Approved modifications in the specifications, quantities, design, or other attributes defined in the original Istisna\u2019a contract the implementation of which affects the contract costs.\n    *   **Additional Claims**\n        *   Amounts in excess of the agreed Istisna\u2019a contract price which are claimed by Al-Sani\u2019 for delays, errors in the specifications and designs or other causes of unanticipated costs caused by Al-Mustasni\u2019. Recognition of these claims by Al-Sani\u2019 requires the satisfaction of the following conditions:\n            *   a) The existence of a legal basis for the additional claim supported by objective and verifiable evidence.\n            *   b) Claims must be due to circumstances that were unforeseeable at the contract date and are not the result of the deficiencies, fault or negligence of Al-Sani\u2019.\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2/5 Change orders and additional claims**\n        *   a) ...\n        *   b) If requisite conditions for recognizing additional claims are met, a related amount of revenue shall be recognized equal to the additional cost caused by such claims. (para. 24)\n        *   c) If one or more requisite conditions for recognizing additional claims are not met, the estimated value of these claims shall be disclosed... (para. 25)\n        *   d) When a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists... However, the cost of change orders and additional claims are determined by the subcontractor (Al-Sani\u2019) in the parallel contract and subject to the approval of the Islamic bank. (para. 26)\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n*   **Appendix (F) Definitions**\n    *   **Change Orders**\n        *   Approved modifications in the specifications, scope, functionalities, design, or other attributes defined in the original Istisna\u2019a contract the implementation of which affects the contract price or costs. **This may include adjustments resulting from iterative development or refinements identified during the creation process, provided they are approved by Al-Mustasni\u2019.**\n    *   **Additional Claims**\n        *   Amounts in excess of the agreed Istisna\u2019a contract price which are claimed by Al-Sani\u2019 for delays, errors in the specifications and designs, **unforeseen technical challenges encountered during the creation process,** or other causes of unanticipated costs caused by Al-Mustasni\u2019. Recognition of these claims by Al-Sani\u2019 requires the satisfaction of the following conditions:\n            *   a) The existence of a contractual or legal basis for the additional claim supported by objective and verifiable evidence.\n            *   b) Claims must be due to circumstances or **technical discoveries** that were unforeseeable at the contract date and are not the result of the deficiencies, fault or negligence of Al-Sani\u2019 in executing the agreed-upon process.\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2/5 Change orders and additional claims**\n        *   a) ...\n        *   b) If requisite conditions for recognizing additional claims are met, a related amount of revenue shall be recognized equal to the additional cost caused by such claims. (para. 24)\n        *   c) If one or more requisite conditions for recognizing additional claims are not met, the estimated value of these claims shall be disclosed... (para. 25)\n        *   d) When a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists... However, the cost of change orders and additional claims are determined by the subcontractor (Al-Sani\u2019) in the parallel contract and subject to the approval of the Islamic bank. **This includes costs arising from unforeseen technical challenges or discoveries in the parallel contract, subject to the conditions in the head contract with Al-Mustasni\u2019.** (para. 26)\n\n**Rationale for Change:**\nSoftware and AI development often involve iterative processes and encountering unforeseen technical hurdles unique to the specific problem being solved. The current framework for changes and claims, while sound for traditional projects, doesn't explicitly accommodate this. The proposed changes acknowledge that change orders can arise from the *process* of development itself (iterative refinement) and that additional claims can stem from unforeseen *technical challenges* inherent in creating a novel asset, provided these are properly documented, justified, and agreed upon. This provides a more flexible yet controlled mechanism for handling scope and cost adjustments in dynamic projects, aligning the standard with the realities of modern technology development while upholding Shari'ah principles of clarity and fairness in contracts.\n\n**How it Addresses the Trigger Scenario:**\nThis addresses the dynamic nature of building a large-scale AI platform. Development often involves discovering better ways to implement features, refining algorithms based on testing, or encountering unexpected technical difficulties. The proposed changes make it clearer that adjustments resulting from these processes can be formalized as Change Orders (if approved modifications) or potentially Additional Claims (if stemming from unforeseeable technical challenges), providing a framework for managing the contract and its accounting implications through the iterative development lifecycle.\n\n---",
    "validation": "Okay, Standards Validator Agent reporting for duty. I have reviewed the proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 regarding its application to intangible assets, specifically an AI software platform Istisna'a contract.\n\nHere is the validation of each proposed enhancement:\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 1: Clarifying the Definition of Al-Masnoo' for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Explicitly include \"intangible, or a combination thereof\" in the definition of Al-Masnoo' and provide specific guidance for specifying intangible assets based on functionalities, performance, scope, etc., in Appendix C, para 4/1/1.\n*   **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n    *   **Principle:** Prohibition of Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty). A core condition for Istisna'a validity is that the subject matter (Al-Masnoo') must be known and specified to remove uncertainty (Appendix C, para 4/1/1).\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposed change does not introduce Gharar; rather, it clarifies *how* the existing requirement of specifying Al-Masnoo' applies to intangible assets. By providing relevant criteria for specification (functionalities, performance, scope), it ensures that the subject matter, although intangible and non-existent at the time of contract, is defined with sufficient clarity to prevent excessive uncertainty regarding what the Sani' is obligated to produce and the Mustasni' is entitled to receive. This aligns with the Shariah principle of clarity in contracts, adapted for the nature of intangible assets. The validity of Istisna'a itself is based on necessity (Maslaha) and analogy (Qiyas) despite the subject matter being non-existent at contract inception (Appendix C, para 3), focusing on the *specification* of what will be created. This proposal enhances that specification for a modern asset class.\n*   **Consistency Check:**\n    *   **Internal (FAS 10):** The proposal aligns the main text (Appendix C, para 4/1/1) with footnote (7), which already mentions services as a possible subject matter. It provides necessary detail for applying the specification requirement to non-physical items, which was previously lacking. This enhances internal consistency.\n    *   **External (Related Standards):** Other AAOIFI standards, such as FAS 4 (Musharaka), implicitly acknowledge intangible assets as valid items for contribution to capital (Appendix D), indicating AAOIFI's scope extends beyond tangibles. This proposal is consistent with the broader recognition of intangible assets in Islamic finance frameworks.\n*   **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** Specifying software or AI platforms based on functionalities, performance parameters, technical requirements, and scope is standard practice in the technology industry. This proposal makes the standard practical and applicable to such contracts, which are increasingly common.\n*   **Conclusion for Proposal 1:** APPROVED. It enhances the standard's applicability to modern assets while upholding Shariah principles of clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 2: Inclusion of Directly Related R&D Costs in Istisna'a Costs**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Amend Statement of the Standard, para 2/1(a) to include \"Research and development costs that are integral and specific to the creation of the contracted Al-Masnoo\u2019\" in Istisna'a contract costs, while excluding general R&D.\n*   **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n    *   **Principle:** This proposal primarily relates to accounting treatment (cost recognition) rather than core Shariah prohibitions like Riba, Gharar, or Maysir, or the fixed price nature of Istisna'a.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Shariah requires the contract price to be fixed and known in Istisna'a (Appendix C, para 2). The internal cost accounting of the Sani' does not alter this fixed price agreed with the Mustasni'. Including specific R&D costs as part of the cost of creating Al-Masnoo' is an accounting decision about how to measure the asset being built. It accurately reflects the economic cost incurred by the Sani' to fulfill the specific contract. This does not violate any Shariah principle and aligns with the general Shariah objective of fairness and transparency in business operations by providing a more accurate depiction of the cost of the asset under construction.\n*   **Consistency Check:**\n    *   **Internal (FAS 10):** The original exclusion in para 2/1(a) likely intended to exclude *general* R&D that benefits the entity as a whole, not R&D specifically required for a contracted item. The proposed change clarifies this, making the standard's cost recognition more precise and consistent with the concept of accumulating costs for a specific contract asset (Istisna'a work-in-progress, para 2/1(b)). This improved cost measurement is necessary for applying the percentage-of-completion method accurately (para 2/3/1/1).\n    *   **External (Related Standards):** While not explicitly mentioned in the provided snippets, general accounting principles often permit capitalization of R&D costs directly attributable to the creation of a specific asset, especially if criteria for probable future economic benefits are met. This change aligns the standard's cost accounting with the economic reality of creating complex, novel assets.\n*   **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** Distinguishing between general R&D and project-specific R&D is a common practice in project accounting, particularly in industries involving significant development work (like software). This proposal is practically implementable by financial institutions involved in financing such projects.\n*   **Conclusion for Proposal 2:** APPROVED. It provides a more accurate and relevant accounting treatment for the cost of creating specific, complex Istisna'a assets, without violating Shariah principles.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 3: Guidance on Cost Estimation for Complex/Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Add text to Statement of the Standard, para 2/3/1/1 and Appendix E acknowledging the difficulty of cost estimation for complex/intangible assets and suggesting methods (robust methodologies, iterative processes, frequent review) to achieve \"reasonable accuracy\".\n*   **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n    *   **Principle:** Prohibition of Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty), Transparency and Fairness. Accurate cost estimation is crucial for the percentage-of-completion method to ensure that profit recognition reflects the true progress and likely outcome of the contract, avoiding misrepresentation (Gharar in reporting).\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal does not weaken the requirement for \"reasonable accuracy\"; it provides guidance on *how* to achieve it in challenging scenarios. By suggesting robust processes and frequent reviews, it aims to *improve* the reliability of estimates over the project lifecycle, thereby reducing the risk of significant misstatements and enhancing transparency in financial reporting. This supports the Shariah principle of avoiding misleading information.\n*   **Consistency Check:**\n    *   **Internal (FAS 10):** This proposal directly supports the application of the preferred percentage-of-completion method (para 2/3/1/1) by providing practical context for the \"reasonable accuracy\" condition. It is fully consistent with the standard's existing accounting framework.\n    *   **External (Related Standards):** No conflict with other standards is apparent. This is a specific accounting implementation detail for Istisna'a contracts.\n*   **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** Project management best practices for complex projects like software development inherently involve iterative planning, estimation, and frequent re-forecasting as uncertainties are resolved. The proposed guidance reflects these practical realities and suggests that applying such discipline can allow for the use of the percentage-of-completion method. It is implementable.\n*   **Conclusion for Proposal 3:** APPROVED. It provides valuable practical guidance for applying the preferred accounting method to complex projects, supporting accurate financial reporting.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 4: Adapting Change Order and Additional Claim Framework for Iterative Development**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Modify definitions of Change Orders and Additional Claims (Appendix F) and related text (Statement of the Standard, para 2/5) to explicitly include iterative development refinements and unforeseen technical challenges as potential bases for adjustments, subject to existing conditions (approval, unforeseeability, not due to Sani's fault).\n*   **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n    *   **Principle:** Prohibition of Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty), Fixed Price (Istisna'a Specific Principle). The fixed price is a key feature of Istisna'a to avoid Gharar. Change Orders and Additional Claims are permissible mechanisms to adjust the fixed price under specific, controlled circumstances.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposed change does not undermine the fixed-price nature of Istisna'a. It merely broadens the *types* of events that can trigger a formal Change Order (requiring Mustasni's approval, Appendix F) or an Additional Claim (requiring strict conditions like unforeseeability and lack of Sani's fault, Appendix F). By explicitly including iterative refinements (requiring approval as Change Orders) and unforeseen technical challenges (potentially justifying Additional Claims if meeting criteria), the proposal acknowledges the realities of complex development while keeping the adjustments subject to control mechanisms (agreement/approval for changes, strict conditions for claims) already present in the standard. This maintains clarity and fairness in the contract adjustment process, consistent with Shariah principles. The Sani's liability for delivering the specified product remains (Appendix C, para 4/2/1); these clauses address adjustments when the *specifications themselves change* or when *unforeseen, external-like technical issues* (not Sani's fault) impact costs.\n*   **Consistency Check:**\n    *   **Internal (FAS 10):** The proposal builds upon the existing framework for handling contract modifications (para 2/5, Appendix F). It provides necessary clarification on how this framework applies to the specific dynamics of software/AI development, enhancing the standard's completeness and consistency for these types of contracts.\n    *   **External (Related Standards):** No conflict with other standards is apparent. This is a specific contractual and accounting detail for Istisna'a.\n*   **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** Managing scope changes and handling unforeseen issues through formal change orders and claim processes are standard components of contracts for complex projects, including software development. The proposed changes make the standard more practical by explicitly accommodating these realities within the existing Istisna'a framework.\n*   **Conclusion for Proposal 4:** APPROVED. It adapts the standard's framework for contract adjustments to the realities of complex development projects while preserving the necessary control mechanisms and Shariah compliance.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Validation Summary:**\n\nAll four proposed enhancements address practical challenges encountered when applying AAOIFI FAS 10 to Istisna'a contracts for complex intangible assets like AI software platforms. Each proposal aims to clarify or adapt existing principles and accounting treatments within the standard to fit the unique nature of such projects.\n\n*   **Shariah Compliance:** None of the proposals appear to violate core Shariah principles. They either clarify how existing principles (like specification to avoid Gharar) apply to intangible assets or refine accounting treatments without introducing Riba, Maysir, or excessive, uncontrolled Gharar. The fixed price nature of Istisna'a is respected, with mechanisms for controlled adjustments retained.\n*   **Consistency:** The proposals enhance internal consistency within FAS 10 by explicitly addressing intangible assets and refining the application of existing rules (specification, cost inclusion, estimation, change management) to this context. They do not appear to conflict with the provided context from other AAOIFI standards.\n*   **Practical Implementation:** The proposals reflect standard practices in managing and accounting for complex software/AI development projects, making the standard more practical and applicable to these increasingly common transactions.\n\nBased on the detailed assessment above, the proposed enhancements are well-reasoned, align with Shariah principles, maintain consistency, and improve practicality.\n\n**Final Decision:** APPROVED.",

Also Appendix (C), para 2 Definition and Appendix (F) Definitions, Istisna\u2019a, which define the subject matter as \"Al-Masnoo' (the subject matter of the contract) according to the specifications\". Appendix C, para 3(7) footnote states \"The subject matter may be a commodity, service or both.\"\n\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** While footnote (7) acknowledges that the subject matter can be a \"service or both,\" the detailed requirements in 4/1/1 (kind, type, quality, quantity) and the general framing of Al-Masnoo' throughout the standard (e.g., mentioning \"manufacturing\" repeatedly) are heavily oriented towards tangible goods or more standardized services (like construction). Defining \"kind,\" \"type,\" \"quality,\" and \"quantity\" precisely for a complex, large-scale AI software platform at the outset of the contract is inherently difficult. Software quality (performance, reliability, scalability, accuracy of AI models) and quantity (feature sets, data handling capacity) can be hard to specify exhaustively and immutably from the beginning.\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** AI software development often involves significant research, experimentation, and iterative refinement. The final \"quality\" and \"quantity\" of the platform may evolve based on testing, data availability, and user feedback during the development process. The standard's requirement for a precisely \"known and specified\" subject matter upfront poses a challenge for structuring Istisna'a for projects where the exact outcome and specifications are subject to discovery and change, creating uncertainty about contract validity and the basis for measuring progress.\n\n**2. Specific Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, para 2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs, specifically point (I) defining Direct costs and the explicit exclusion: \"General and admin-istrative expenses, selling expenses, **research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs**.\" Also Appendix (F) Definitions: Istisna\u2019a Work-in-Progress Account, Istisna\u2019a Costs Account, which accumulate \"Istisna'a contract costs\".\n\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** The standard explicitly excludes \"research and development costs\" from Istisna'a contract costs. In the context of developing novel or large-scale AI software, a substantial, perhaps even primary, component of the development effort *is* research and development. This includes activities like algorithm selection and tuning, data model training, creating novel functionalities, and resolving complex technical challenges that haven't been solved before. The line between \"producing Al-Masnoo'\" and \"research and development\" is often blurred or non-existent in cutting-edge software development, particularly AI.\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** If significant portions of the AI software development costs are classified as \"research and development\" and thus excluded from Istisna'a costs according to para 2/1, the accumulated \"Istisna\u2019a work-in-progress account\" or \"Istisna\u2019a costs account\" will not reflect the true economic cost incurred in developing the asset. This undermines the basis for applying the percentage-of-completion method (which relies on measuring progress based on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs) and misrepresents the asset value being created on the balance sheet. The standard's cost definition seems incompatible with the cost structure of modern, R&D-heavy software projects like AI platforms.\n\n**3. Specific Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, para 2/3/1/1 Percentage of completion method and Appendix (E) Basis for Conclusions, Recognition of Istisna\u2019a Profit, point (a) which states that a crucial condition for applying this method is that \"the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy.\"\n\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** The preferred accounting method for profit recognition (percentage-of-completion) relies heavily on the ability to estimate the total cost of the contract with \"reasonable accuracy.\"\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** As mentioned, large-scale AI software development projects often involve significant technical uncertainty and R&D. Predicting the exact time and resources required to overcome challenges, optimize performance, and finalize features makes estimating the *total* cost with \"reasonable accuracy\" very difficult. This forces the use of the less preferred completed-contract method, delaying profit recognition until completion, which may not accurately reflect the economic substance of the ongoing development work and could impact financial reporting and profit distribution to stakeholders.\n\n**4. Specific Section/Clause:** Appendix (F) Definitions: Change Orders, Additional Claims. Statement of the Standard, para 2/5 Change orders and additional claims.\n\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** The standard provides a framework for handling changes and additional claims. \"Change Orders\" are \"Approved modifications in the specifications... which affects the contract costs.\" \"Additional Claims\" are for amounts in excess of the price for causes like delays, errors, or \"other causes of unanticipated costs caused by Al-Mustasni\u2019,\" requiring a legal basis and unforeseeable circumstances \"not the result of the deficiencies, fault or negligence of Al-Sani\u2019.\"\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** Iterative development, common in software and essential for AI, involves frequent adjustments and refinements that may not always fit the formal process implied by \"Approved modifications\" or \"Change Orders\" designed for physical construction. Furthermore, the \"unforeseen circumstances\" leading to cost overruns in AI development are often inherent technical challenges or discoveries during the R&D process, not necessarily caused by Al-Mustasni' or clearly distinct from Al-Sani's \"deficiencies\" (e.g., inability to predict R&D outcomes). The standard's framework seems less suited to the dynamic and exploratory nature of AI development projects.\n\nIn summary, while FAS 10's flexibility in allowing Istisna'a for services helps, its roots in tangible manufacturing and the explicit exclusion of R&D costs pose significant challenges for applying it effectively to complex, R&D-heavy intangible assets like AI software platforms. The requirements for upfront specification and reliable cost estimation are also difficult to meet in this context."

Specific Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, para 2/3/1/1 Percentage of completion method and Appendix (E) Basis for Conclusions, Recognition of Istisna\u2019a Profit, point (a) which states that a crucial condition for applying this method is that \"the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy.\"\n\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** The preferred accounting method for profit recognition (percentage-of-completion) relies heavily on the ability to estimate the total cost of the contract with \"reasonable accuracy.\"\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** As mentioned, large-scale AI software development projects often involve significant technical uncertainty and R&D. Predicting the exact time and resources required to overcome challenges, optimize performance, and finalize features makes estimating the *total* cost with \"reasonable accuracy\" very difficult. This forces the use of the less preferred completed-contract method, delaying profit recognition until completion, which may not accurately reflect the economic substance of the ongoing development work and could impact financial reporting and profit distribution to stakeholders.\n\n**4. Specific Section/Clause:** Appendix (F) Definitions: Change Orders, Additional Claims. Statement of the Standard, para 2/5 Change orders and additional claims.\n\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity Identified:** The standard provides a framework for handling changes and additional claims. \"Change Orders\" are \"Approved modifications in the specifications... which affects the contract costs.\" \"Additional Claims\" are for amounts in excess of the price for causes like delays, errors, or \"other causes of unanticipated costs caused by Al-Mustasni\u2019,\" requiring a legal basis and unforeseeable circumstances \"not the result of the deficiencies, fault or negligence of Al-Sani\u2019.\"\n*   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** Iterative development, common in software and essential for AI, involves frequent adjustments and refinements that may not always fit the formal process implied by \"Approved modifications\" or \"Change Orders\" designed for physical construction. Furthermore, the \"unforeseen circumstances\" leading to cost overruns in AI development are often inherent technical challenges or discoveries during the R&D process, not necessarily caused by Al-Mustasni' or clearly distinct from Al-Sani's \"deficiencies\" (e.g., inability to predict R&D outcomes). The standard's framework seems less suited to the dynamic and exploratory nature of AI development projects.\n\nIn summary, while FAS 10's flexibility in allowing Istisna'a for services helps, its roots in tangible manufacturing and the explicit exclusion of R&D costs pose significant challenges for applying it effectively to complex, R&D-heavy intangible assets like AI software platforms. The requirements for upfront specification and reliable cost estimation are also difficult to meet in this context.",

The proposed changes explicitly include intangible assets in the definition and provide a framework for specifying them based on functional, performance, and scope characteristics, which are the relevant attributes for software and similar intangible products, rather than physical kind, type, quality, and quantity. This aligns the standard with modern economic activities and ensures Shari'ah compliance by maintaining the requirement for clearly defined subject matter, adapted for the nature of intangible assets.\n\n**How it Addresses the Trigger Scenario:**\nThis change directly addresses the uncertainty in specifying a large-scale AI software platform. Instead of trying to shoehorn software into categories like \"kind\" or \"quantity\" in a physical sense, the standard would explicitly permit specification based on functionalities (e.g., natural language processing, image recognition), performance metrics (e.g., accuracy rate, processing speed), technical architecture, and the overall scope of the platform. This provides a clearer basis for contract validity and measurement of progress for intangible assets.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 2: Inclusion of Directly Related R&D Costs in Istisna'a Costs**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The explicit exclusion of \"research and development costs\" from Istisna'a contract costs in Statement of the Standard, para 2/1, contradicts the nature of Istisna'a when the contract *is* for the creation of a novel asset where R&D is an integral part of the production process, as is common in AI software development.\n\n**Original Text (Relevant Snippet):**\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)**\n        *   **2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs**\n            *   a) Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and admin-istrative expenses, selling expenses, **research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs.**\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)**\n        *   **2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs**\n            *   a) Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs directly and specifically related to the production or creation of Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating directly to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. **Research and development costs that are integral and specific to the creation of the contracted Al-Masnoo\u2019 shall be included in Istisna\u2019a contract costs.** General and administrative expenses and selling expenses shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs.\n\n**Rationale for Change:**\nThe original exclusion of R&D costs appears to be based on a model where R&D is a general corporate activity. However, in an Istisna'a contract for a novel or complex item like custom software or an AI platform, the R&D required to achieve the contracted specifications *is* the cost of producing that specific item. Excluding these costs misrepresents the total investment in creating Al-Masnoo' and undermines the basis for profit recognition methods like percentage-of-completion. The proposed change distinguishes between general R&D and R&D specifically undertaken as part of the Istisna'a production process, allowing the latter to be capitalized as contract costs, which is consistent with the economic reality of creating a tailored asset under Istisna'a.\n\n**How it Addresses the Trigger Scenario:**\nThis is crucial for the AI software platform scenario. Development of such a platform involves significant R&D (algorithm selection, model training, novel feature development). Under the original standard, these costs would likely be expensed, leading to an under-recognition of the asset being built and distorting the financial performance reported under Istisna'a. The proposed change allows these integral R&D costs to be properly included in the Istisna'a work-in-progress, providing a more accurate reflection of the asset's cost and enabling proper application of revenue recognition methods.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 3: Guidance on Cost Estimation for Complex/Intangible Assets**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The preferred percentage-of-completion method requires \"reasonable accuracy\" in estimating total contract costs (para 2/3/1/1, Appendix E). This is inherently difficult for complex, R&D-heavy projects like AI software development where technical uncertainties exist.\n\n**Original Text (Relevant Snippet):**\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2/3/1/1 Percentage of completion method**\n        *   ...A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy. (para. 8, 9)\n*   **Appendix (E) Basis for Conclusions**\n    *   **Recognition of Istisna\u2019a Profit**\n        *   ...A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy.\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2/3/1/1 Percentage of completion method**\n        *   ...A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy. **For contracts involving complex or intangible assets, particularly those with significant integrated research and development components, achieving reasonable accuracy in cost estimation may require the use of robust project management methodologies, iterative estimation processes, and frequent review and revision of estimates as the project progresses and uncertainties are resolved.**\n*   **Appendix (E) Basis for Conclusions**\n    *   **Recognition of Istisna\u2019a Profit**\n        *   ...A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy. **The assessment of whether reasonable accuracy can be achieved should consider the nature and complexity of the Al-Masnoo', including whether it involves significant integrated research and development. For such complex projects, robust estimation techniques and processes for frequent estimate revisions are expected.**\n\n**Rationale for Change:**\nThe standard correctly identifies reliable cost estimation as key to the percentage-of-completion method. However, it doesn't acknowledge the varying degrees of difficulty in achieving this based on project type. By adding guidance specific to complex or R&D-heavy intangible assets, the standard provides direction on *how* to approach estimation in these cases, implicitly recognizing that while challenging, it may still be possible to achieve \"reasonable accuracy\" through appropriate project management and estimation practices. This encourages the use of the preferred method where feasible, even for complex projects, rather than defaulting to the completed-contract method solely due to perceived estimation difficulty without guidance.\n\n**How it Addresses the Trigger Scenario:**\nThis addresses the challenge of estimating costs for the AI platform. The proposed text acknowledges that estimating costs for AI development is complex but suggests that employing specific techniques (like iterative refinement, frequent reviews) can help achieve the necessary \"reasonable accuracy.\" This provides a pathway for financial institutions to potentially use the percentage-of-completion method for such contracts, reflecting the economic substance of the ongoing development work and allowing for timely profit recognition.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 4: Adapting Change Order and Additional Claim Framework for Iterative Development**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The framework for Change Orders and Additional Claims (Appendix F Definitions, Statement of the Standard, para 2/5) seems more suited to fixed-scope construction/manufacturing and may not adequately capture the iterative nature of software development or cost impacts from unforeseen technical *discoveries* inherent in R&D, rather than just external factors or Al-Mustasni's actions.\n\n**Original Text (Relevant Snippets):**\n\n*   **Appendix (F) Definitions**\n    *   **Change Orders**\n        *   Approved modifications in the specifications, quantities, design, or other attributes defined in the original Istisna\u2019a contract the implementation of which affects the contract costs.\n    *   **Additional Claims**\n        *   Amounts in excess of the agreed Istisna\u2019a contract price which are claimed by Al-Sani\u2019 for delays, errors in the specifications and designs or other causes of unanticipated costs caused by Al-Mustasni\u2019. Recognition of these claims by Al-Sani\u2019 requires the satisfaction of the following conditions:\n            *   a) The existence of a legal basis for the additional claim supported by objective and verifiable evidence.\n            *   b) Claims must be due to circumstances that were unforeseeable at the contract date and are not the result of the deficiencies, fault or negligence of Al-Sani\u2019.\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2/5 Change orders and additional claims**\n        *   a) ...\n        *   b) If requisite conditions for recognizing additional claims are met, a related amount of revenue shall be recognized equal to the additional cost caused by such claims. (para. 24)\n        *   c) If one or more requisite conditions for recognizing additional claims are not met, the estimated value of these claims shall be disclosed... (para. 25)\n        *   d) When a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists... However, the cost of change orders and additional claims are determined by the subcontractor (Al-Sani\u2019) in the parallel contract and subject to the approval of the Islamic bank. (para. 26)\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n*   **Appendix (F) Definitions**\n    *   **Change Orders**\n        *   Approved modifications in the specifications, scope, functionalities, design, or other attributes defined in the original Istisna\u2019a contract the implementation of which affects the contract price or costs. **This may include adjustments resulting from iterative development or refinements identified during the creation process, provided they are approved by Al-Mustasni\u2019.**\n    *   **Additional Claims**\n        *   Amounts in excess of the agreed Istisna\u2019a contract price which are claimed by Al-Sani\u2019 for delays, errors in the specifications and designs, **unforeseen technical challenges encountered during the creation process,** or other causes of unanticipated costs caused by Al-Mustasni\u2019. Recognition of these claims by Al-Sani\u2019 requires the satisfaction of the following conditions:\n            *   a) The existence of a contractual or legal basis for the additional claim supported by objective and verifiable evidence.\n            *   b) Claims must be due to circumstances or **technical discoveries** that were unforeseeable at the contract date and are not the result of the deficiencies, fault or negligence of Al-Sani\u2019 in executing the agreed-upon process.\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2/5 Change orders and additional claims**\n        *   a) ...\n        *   b) If requisite conditions for recognizing additional claims are met, a related amount of revenue shall be recognized equal to the additional cost caused by such claims. (para. 24)\n        *   c) If one or more requisite conditions for recognizing additional claims are not met, the estimated value of these claims shall be disclosed... (para. 25)\n        *   d) When a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists... However, the cost of change orders and additional claims are determined by the subcontractor (Al-Sani\u2019) in the parallel contract and subject to the approval of the Islamic bank. **This includes costs arising from unforeseen technical challenges or discoveries in the parallel contract, subject to the conditions in the head contract with Al-Mustasni\u2019.** (para. 26)\n\n**Rationale for Change:**\nSoftware and AI development often involve iterative processes and encountering unforeseen technical hurdles unique to the specific problem being solved. The current framework for changes and claims, while sound for traditional projects, doesn't explicitly accommodate this. The proposed changes acknowledge that change orders can arise from the *process* of development itself (iterative refinement) and that additional claims can stem from unforeseen *technical challenges* inherent in creating a novel asset, provided these are properly documented, justified, and agreed upon. This provides a more flexible yet controlled mechanism for handling scope and cost adjustments in dynamic projects, aligning the standard with the realities of modern technology development while upholding Shari'ah principles of clarity and fairness in contracts.\n\n**How it Addresses the Trigger Scenario:**\nThis addresses the dynamic nature of building a large-scale AI platform. Development often involves discovering better ways to implement features, refining algorithms based on testing, or encountering unexpected technical difficulties. The proposed changes make it clearer that adjustments resulting from these processes can be formalized as Change Orders (if approved modifications) or potentially Additional Claims (if stemming from unforeseeable technical challenges), providing a framework for managing the contract and its accounting implications through the iterative development lifecycle.\n\n---"

Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)**\n        *   **2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs**\n            *   a) Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs directly and specifically related to the production or creation of Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating directly to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. **Research and development costs that are integral and specific to the creation of the contracted Al-Masnoo\u2019 shall be included in Istisna\u2019a contract costs.** General and administrative expenses and selling expenses shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs.\n\n**Rationale for Change:**\nThe original exclusion of R&D costs appears to be based on a model where R&D is a general corporate activity. However, in an Istisna'a contract for a novel or complex item like custom software or an AI platform, the R&D required to achieve the contracted specifications *is* the cost of producing that specific item. Excluding these costs misrepresents the total investment in creating Al-Masnoo' and undermines the basis for profit recognition methods like percentage-of-completion. The proposed change distinguishes between general R&D and R&D specifically undertaken as part of the Istisna'a production process, allowing the latter to be capitalized as contract costs, which is consistent with the economic reality of creating a tailored asset under Istisna'a.\n\n**How it Addresses the Trigger Scenario:**\nThis is crucial for the AI software platform scenario. Development of such a platform involves significant R&D (algorithm selection, model training, novel feature development). Under the original standard, these costs would likely be expensed, leading to an under-recognition of the asset being built and distorting the financial performance reported under Istisna'a. The proposed change allows these integral R&D costs to be properly included in the Istisna'a work-in-progress, providing a more accurate reflection of the asset's cost and enabling proper application of revenue recognition methods.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 3: Guidance on Cost Estimation for Complex/Intangible Assets**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The preferred percentage-of-completion method requires \"reasonable accuracy\" in estimating total contract costs (para 2/3/1/1, Appendix E). This is inherently difficult for complex, R&D-heavy projects like AI software development where technical uncertainties exist.\n\n**Original Text (Relevant Snippet):**\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2/3/1/1 Percentage of completion method**\n        *   ...A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy. (para. 8, 9)\n*   **Appendix (E) Basis for Conclusions**\n    *   **Recognition of Istisna\u2019a Profit**\n        *   ...A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy.\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2/3/1/1 Percentage of completion method**\n        *   ...A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy. **For contracts involving complex or intangible assets, particularly those with significant integrated research and development components, achieving reasonable accuracy in cost estimation may require the use of robust project management methodologies, iterative estimation processes, and frequent review and revision of estimates as the project progresses and uncertainties are resolved.**\n*   **Appendix (E) Basis for Conclusions**\n    *   **Recognition of Istisna\u2019a Profit**\n        *   ...A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy. **The assessment of whether reasonable accuracy can be achieved should consider the nature and complexity of the Al-Masnoo', including whether it involves significant integrated research and development. For such complex projects, robust estimation techniques and processes for frequent estimate revisions are expected.**\n\n**Rationale for Change:**\nThe standard correctly identifies reliable cost estimation as key to the percentage-of-completion method. However, it doesn't acknowledge the varying degrees of difficulty in achieving this based on project type. By adding guidance specific to complex or R&D-heavy intangible assets, the standard provides direction on *how* to approach estimation in these cases, implicitly recognizing that while challenging, it may still be possible to achieve \"reasonable accuracy\" through appropriate project management and estimation practices. This encourages the use of the preferred method where feasible, even for complex projects, rather than defaulting to the completed-contract method solely due to perceived estimation difficulty without guidance.\n\n**How it Addresses the Trigger Scenario:**\nThis addresses the challenge of estimating costs for the AI platform. The proposed text acknowledges that estimating costs for AI development is complex but suggests that employing specific techniques (like iterative refinement, frequent reviews) can help achieve the necessary \"reasonable accuracy.\" This provides a pathway for financial institutions to potentially use the percentage-of-completion method for such contracts, reflecting the economic substance of the ongoing development work and allowing for timely profit recognition.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 4: Adapting Change Order and Additional Claim Framework for Iterative Development**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The framework for Change Orders and Additional Claims (Appendix F Definitions, Statement of the Standard, para 2/5) seems more suited to fixed-scope construction/manufacturing and may not adequately capture the iterative nature of software development or cost impacts from unforeseen technical *discoveries* inherent in R&D, rather than just external factors or Al-Mustasni's actions.\n\n**Original Text (Relevant Snippets):**\n\n*   **Appendix (F) Definitions**\n    *   **Change Orders**\n        *   Approved modifications in the specifications, quantities, design, or other attributes defined in the original Istisna\u2019a contract the implementation of which affects the contract costs.\n    *   **Additional Claims**\n        *   Amounts in excess of the agreed Istisna\u2019a contract price which are claimed by Al-Sani\u2019 for delays, errors in the specifications and designs or other causes of unanticipated costs caused by Al-Mustasni\u2019. Recognition of these claims by Al-Sani\u2019 requires the satisfaction of the following conditions:\n            *   a) The existence of a legal basis for the additional claim supported by objective and verifiable evidence.\n            *   b) Claims must be due to circumstances that were unforeseeable at the contract date and are not the result of the deficiencies, fault or negligence of Al-Sani\u2019.\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2/5 Change orders and additional claims**\n        *   a) ...\n        *   b) If requisite conditions for recognizing additional claims are met, a related amount of revenue shall be recognized equal to the additional cost caused by such claims. (para. 24)\n        *   c) If one or more requisite conditions for recognizing additional claims are not met, the estimated value of these claims shall be disclosed... (para. 25)\n        *   d) When a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists... However, the cost of change orders and additional claims are determined by the subcontractor (Al-Sani\u2019) in the parallel contract and subject to the approval of the Islamic bank. (para. 26)\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n*   **Appendix (F) Definitions**\n    *   **Change Orders**\n        *   Approved modifications in the specifications, scope, functionalities, design, or other attributes defined in the original Istisna\u2019a contract the implementation of which affects the contract price or costs. **This may include adjustments resulting from iterative development or refinements identified during the creation process, provided they are approved by Al-Mustasni\u2019.**\n    *   **Additional Claims**\n        *   Amounts in excess of the agreed Istisna\u2019a contract price which are claimed by Al-Sani\u2019 for delays, errors in the specifications and designs, **unforeseen technical challenges encountered during the creation process,** or other causes of unanticipated costs caused by Al-Mustasni\u2019. Recognition of these claims by Al-Sani\u2019 requires the satisfaction of the following conditions:\n            *   a) The existence of a contractual or legal basis for the additional claim supported by objective and verifiable evidence.\n            *   b) Claims must be due to circumstances or **technical discoveries** that were unforeseeable at the contract date and are not the result of the deficiencies, fault or negligence of Al-Sani\u2019 in executing the agreed-upon process.\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2/5 Change orders and additional claims**\n        *   a) ...\n        *   b) If requisite conditions for recognizing additional claims are met, a related amount of revenue shall be recognized equal to the additional cost caused by such claims. (para. 24)\n        *   c) If one or more requisite conditions for recognizing additional claims are not met, the estimated value of these claims shall be disclosed... (para. 25)\n        *   d) When a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists... However, the cost of change orders and additional claims are determined by the subcontractor (Al-Sani\u2019) in the parallel contract and subject to the approval of the Islamic bank. **This includes costs arising from unforeseen technical challenges or discoveries in the parallel contract, subject to the conditions in the head contract with Al-Mustasni\u2019.** (para. 26)\n\n**Rationale for Change:**\nSoftware and AI development often involve iterative processes and encountering unforeseen technical hurdles unique to the specific problem being solved. The current framework for changes and claims, while sound for traditional projects, doesn't explicitly accommodate this. The proposed changes acknowledge that change orders can arise from the *process* of development itself (iterative refinement) and that additional claims can stem from unforeseen *technical challenges* inherent in creating a novel asset, provided these are properly documented, justified, and agreed upon. This provides a more flexible yet controlled mechanism for handling scope and cost adjustments in dynamic projects, aligning the standard with the realities of modern technology development while upholding Shari'ah principles of clarity and fairness in contracts.\n\n**How it Addresses the Trigger Scenario:**\nThis addresses the dynamic nature of building a large-scale AI platform. Development often involves discovering better ways to implement features, refining algorithms based on testing, or encountering unexpected technical difficulties. The proposed changes make it clearer that adjustments resulting from these processes can be formalized as Change Orders (if approved modifications) or potentially Additional Claims (if stemming from unforeseeable technical challenges), providing a framework for managing the contract and its accounting implications through the iterative development lifecycle.\n\n---",
        "validation_result": "Okay, Standards Validator Agent reporting for duty. I have reviewed the proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 regarding its application to intangible assets, specifically an AI software platform Istisna'a contract.\n\nHere is the validation of each proposed enhancement:\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 1: Clarifying the Definition of Al-Masnoo' for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Explicitly include \"intangible, or a combination thereof\" in the definition of Al-Masnoo' and provide specific guidance for specifying intangible assets based on functionalities, performance, scope, etc., in Appendix C, para 4/1/1.\n*   **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n    *   **Principle:** Prohibition of Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty). A core condition for Istisna'a validity is that the subject matter (Al-Masnoo') must be known and specified to remove uncertainty (Appendix C, para 4/1/1).\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposed change does not introduce Gharar; rather, it clarifies *how* the existing requirement of specifying Al-Masnoo' applies to intangible assets. By providing relevant criteria for specification (functionalities, performance, scope), it ensures that the subject matter, although intangible and non-existent at the time of contract, is defined with sufficient clarity to prevent excessive uncertainty regarding what the Sani' is obligated to produce and the Mustasni' is entitled to receive. This aligns with the Shariah principle of clarity in contracts, adapted for the nature of intangible assets. The validity of Istisna'a itself is based on necessity (Maslaha) and analogy (Qiyas) despite the subject matter being non-existent at contract inception (Appendix C, para 3), focusing on the *specification* of what will be created. This proposal enhances that specification for a modern asset class.\n*   **Consistency Check:**\n    *   **Internal (FAS 10):** The proposal aligns the main text (Appendix C, para 4/1/1) with footnote (7), which already mentions services as a possible subject matter. It provides necessary detail for applying the specification requirement to non-physical items, which was previously lacking. This enhances internal consistency.\n    *   **External (Related Standards):** Other AAOIFI standards, such as FAS 4 (Musharaka), implicitly acknowledge intangible assets as valid items for contribution to capital (Appendix D), indicating AAOIFI's scope extends beyond tangibles. This proposal is consistent with the broader recognition of intangible assets in Islamic finance frameworks.\n*   **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** Specifying software or AI platforms based on functionalities, performance parameters, technical requirements, and scope is standard practice in the technology industry. This proposal makes the standard practical and applicable to such contracts, which are increasingly common.\n*   **Conclusion for Proposal 1:** APPROVED. It enhances the standard's applicability to modern assets while upholding Shariah principles of clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 2: Inclusion of Directly Related R&D Costs in Istisna'a Costs**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Amend Statement of the Standard, para 2/1(a) to include \"Research and development costs that are integral and specific to the creation of the contracted Al-Masnoo\u2019\" in Istisna'a contract costs, while excluding general R&D.\n*   **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n    *   **Principle:** This proposal primarily relates to accounting treatment (cost recognition) rather than core Shariah prohibitions like Riba, Gharar, or Maysir, or the fixed price nature of Istisna'a.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Shariah requires the contract price to be fixed and known in Istisna'a (Appendix C, para 2). The internal cost accounting of the Sani' does not alter this fixed price agreed with the Mustasni'. Including specific R&D costs as part of the cost of creating Al-Masnoo' is an accounting decision about how to measure the asset being built. It accurately reflects the economic cost incurred by the Sani' to fulfill the specific contract. This does not violate any Shariah principle and aligns with the general Shariah objective of fairness and transparency in business operations by providing a more accurate depiction of the cost of the asset under construction.\n*   **Consistency Check:**\n    *   **Internal (FAS 10):** The original exclusion in para 2/1(a) likely intended to exclude *general* R&D that benefits the entity as a whole, not R&D specifically required for a contracted item. The proposed change clarifies this, making the standard's cost recognition more precise and consistent with the concept of accumulating costs for a specific contract asset (Istisna'a work-in-progress, para 2/1(b)). This improved cost measurement is necessary for applying the percentage-of-completion method accurately (para 2/3/1/1).\n    *   **External (Related Standards):** While not explicitly mentioned in the provided snippets, general accounting principles often permit capitalization of R&D costs directly attributable to the creation of a specific asset, especially if criteria for probable future economic benefits are met. This change aligns the standard's cost accounting with the economic reality of creating complex, novel assets.\n*   **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** Distinguishing between general R&D and project-specific R&D is a common practice in project accounting, particularly in industries involving significant development work (like software). This proposal is practically implementable by financial institutions involved in financing such projects.\n*   **Conclusion for Proposal 2:** APPROVED. It provides a more accurate and relevant accounting treatment for the cost of creating specific, complex Istisna'a assets, without violating Shariah principles.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 3: Guidance on Cost Estimation for Complex/Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Add text to Statement of the Standard, para 2/3/1/1 and Appendix E acknowledging the difficulty of cost estimation for complex/intangible assets and suggesting methods (robust methodologies, iterative processes, frequent review) to achieve \"reasonable accuracy\".\n*   **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n    *   **Principle:** Prohibition of Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty), Transparency and Fairness. Accurate cost estimation is crucial for the percentage-of-completion method to ensure that profit recognition reflects the true progress and likely outcome of the contract, avoiding misrepresentation (Gharar in reporting).\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal does not weaken the requirement for \"reasonable accuracy\"; it provides guidance on *how* to achieve it in challenging scenarios. By suggesting robust processes and frequent reviews, it aims to *improve* the reliability of estimates over the project lifecycle, thereby reducing the risk of significant misstatements and enhancing transparency in financial reporting. This supports the Shariah principle of avoiding misleading information.\n*   **Consistency Check:**\n    *   **Internal (FAS 10):** This proposal directly supports the application of the preferred percentage-of-completion method (para 2/3/1/1) by providing practical context for the \"reasonable accuracy\" condition. It is fully consistent with the standard's existing accounting framework.\n    *   **External (Related Standards):** No conflict with other standards is apparent. This is a specific accounting implementation detail for Istisna'a contracts.\n*   **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** Project management best practices for complex projects like software development inherently involve iterative planning, estimation, and frequent re-forecasting as uncertainties are resolved. The proposed guidance reflects these practical realities and suggests that applying such discipline can allow for the use of the percentage-of-completion method. It is implementable.\n*   **Conclusion for Proposal 3:** APPROVED. It provides valuable practical guidance for applying the preferred accounting method to complex projects, supporting accurate financial reporting.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 4: Adapting Change Order and Additional Claim Framework for Iterative Development**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Modify definitions of Change Orders and Additional Claims (Appendix F) and related text (Statement of the Standard, para 2/5) to explicitly include iterative development refinements and unforeseen technical challenges as potential bases for adjustments, subject to existing conditions (approval, unforeseeability, not due to Sani's fault).\n*   **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n    *   **Principle:** Prohibition of Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty), Fixed Price (Istisna'a Specific Principle). The fixed price is a key feature of Istisna'a to avoid Gharar. Change Orders and Additional Claims are permissible mechanisms to adjust the fixed price under specific, controlled circumstances.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposed change does not undermine the fixed-price nature of Istisna'a. It merely broadens the *types* of events that can trigger a formal Change Order (requiring Mustasni's approval, Appendix F) or an Additional Claim (requiring strict conditions like unforeseeability and lack of Sani's fault, Appendix F). By explicitly including iterative refinements (requiring approval as Change Orders) and unforeseen technical challenges (potentially justifying Additional Claims if meeting criteria), the proposal acknowledges the realities of complex development while keeping the adjustments subject to control mechanisms (agreement/approval for changes, strict conditions for claims) already present in the standard. This maintains clarity and fairness in the contract adjustment process, consistent with Shariah principles. The Sani's liability for delivering the specified product remains (Appendix C, para 4/2/1); these clauses address adjustments when the *specifications themselves change* or when *unforeseen, external-like technical issues* (not Sani's fault) impact costs.\n*   **Consistency Check:**\n    *   **Internal (FAS 10):** The proposal builds upon the existing framework for handling contract modifications (para 2/5, Appendix F). It provides necessary clarification on how this framework applies to the specific dynamics of software/AI development, enhancing the standard's completeness and consistency for these types of contracts.\n    *   **External (Related Standards):** No conflict with other standards is apparent. This is a specific contractual and accounting detail for Istisna'a.\n*   **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** Managing scope changes and handling unforeseen issues through formal change orders and claim processes are standard components of contracts for complex projects, including software development. The proposed changes make the standard more practical by explicitly accommodating these realities within the existing Istisna'a framework.\n*   **Conclusion for Proposal 4:** APPROVED. It adapts the standard's framework for contract adjustments to the realities of complex development projects while preserving the necessary control mechanisms and Shariah compliance.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Validation Summary:**\n\nAll four proposed enhancements address practical challenges encountered when applying AAOIFI FAS 10 to Istisna'a contracts for complex intangible assets like AI software platforms. Each proposal aims to clarify or adapt existing principles and accounting treatments within the standard to fit the unique nature of such projects.\n\n*   **Shariah Compliance:** None of the proposals appear to violate core Shariah principles. They either clarify how existing principles (like specification to avoid Gharar) apply to intangible assets or refine accounting treatments without introducing Riba, Maysir, or excessive, uncontrolled Gharar. The fixed price nature of Istisna'a is respected, with mechanisms for controlled adjustments retained.\n*   **Consistency:** The proposals enhance internal consistency within FAS 10 by explicitly addressing intangible assets and refining the application of existing rules (specification, cost inclusion, estimation, change management) to this context. They do not appear to conflict with the provided context from other AAOIFI standards.\n*   **Practical Implementation:** The proposals reflect standard practices in managing and accounting for complex software/AI development projects, making the standard more practical and applicable to these increasingly common transactions.\n\nBased on the detailed assessment above, the proposed enhancements are well-reasoned, align with Shariah principles, maintain consistency, and improve practicality.\n\n**Final Decision:** APPROVED."

The proposed changes explicitly include intangible assets in the definition and provide a framework for specifying them based on functional, performance, and scope characteristics, which are the relevant attributes for software and similar intangible products, rather than physical kind, type, quality, and quantity. This aligns the standard with modern economic activities and ensures Shari'ah compliance by maintaining the requirement for clearly defined subject matter, adapted for the nature of intangible assets.\n\n**How it Addresses the Trigger Scenario:**\nThis change directly addresses the uncertainty in specifying a large-scale AI software platform. Instead of trying to shoehorn software into categories like \"kind\" or \"quantity\" in a physical sense, the standard would explicitly permit specification based on functionalities (e.g., natural language processing, image recognition), performance metrics (e.g., accuracy rate, processing speed), technical architecture, and the overall scope of the platform. This provides a clearer basis for contract validity and measurement of progress for intangible assets.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 2: Inclusion of Directly Related R&D Costs in Istisna'a Costs**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The explicit exclusion of \"research and development costs\" from Istisna'a contract costs in Statement of the Standard, para 2/1, contradicts the nature of Istisna'a when the contract *is* for the creation of a novel asset where R&D is an integral part of the production process, as is common in AI software development.\n\n**Original Text (Relevant Snippet):**\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2.

However, in an Istisna'a contract for a novel or complex item like custom software or an AI platform, the R&D required to achieve the contracted specifications *is* the cost of producing that specific item. Excluding these costs misrepresents the total investment in creating Al-Masnoo' and undermines the basis for profit recognition methods like percentage-of-completion. The proposed change distinguishes between general R&D and R&D specifically undertaken as part of the Istisna'a production process, allowing the latter to be capitalized as contract costs, which is consistent with the economic reality of creating a tailored asset under Istisna'a.\n\n**How it Addresses the Trigger Scenario:**\nThis is crucial for the AI software platform scenario. Development of such a platform involves significant R&D (algorithm selection, model training, novel feature development). Under the original standard, these costs would likely be expensed, leading to an under-recognition of the asset being built and distorting the financial performance reported under Istisna'a. The proposed change allows these integral R&D costs to be properly included in the Istisna'a work-in-progress, providing a more accurate reflection of the asset's cost and enabling proper application of revenue recognition methods.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 3: Guidance on Cost Estimation for Complex/Intangible Assets**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The preferred percentage-of-completion method requires \"reasonable accuracy\" in estimating total contract costs (para 2/3/1/1, Appendix E). This is inherently difficult for complex, R&D-heavy projects like AI software development where technical uncertainties exist.\n\n**Original Text (Relevant Snippet):**\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2/3/1/1 Percentage of completion method**\n        *   ...A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy. (para. 8, 9)\n*   **Appendix (E) Basis for Conclusions**\n    *   **Recognition of Istisna\u2019a Profit**\n        *   ...A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy.\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2/3/1/1 Percentage of completion method**\n        *   ...A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy. **For contracts involving complex or intangible assets, particularly those with significant integrated research and development components, achieving reasonable accuracy in cost estimation may require the use of robust project management methodologies, iterative estimation processes, and frequent review and revision of estimates as the project progresses and uncertainties are resolved.**\n*   **Appendix (E) Basis for Conclusions**\n    *   **Recognition of Istisna\u2019a Profit**\n        *   ...A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy. **The assessment of whether reasonable accuracy can be achieved should consider the nature and complexity of the Al-Masnoo', including whether it involves significant integrated research and development. For such complex projects, robust estimation techniques and processes for frequent estimate revisions are expected.**\n\n**Rationale for Change:**\nThe standard correctly identifies reliable cost estimation as key to the percentage-of-completion method. However, it doesn't acknowledge the varying degrees of difficulty in achieving this based on project type. By adding guidance specific to complex or R&D-heavy intangible assets, the standard provides direction on *how* to approach estimation in these cases, implicitly recognizing that while challenging, it may still be possible to achieve \"reasonable accuracy\" through appropriate project management and estimation practices. This encourages the use of the preferred method where feasible, even for complex projects, rather than defaulting to the completed-contract method solely due to perceived estimation difficulty without guidance.\n\n**How it Addresses the Trigger Scenario:**\nThis addresses the challenge of estimating costs for the AI platform. The proposed text acknowledges that estimating costs for AI development is complex but suggests that employing specific techniques (like iterative refinement, frequent reviews) can help achieve the necessary \"reasonable accuracy.\" This provides a pathway for financial institutions to potentially use the percentage-of-completion method for such contracts, reflecting the economic substance of the ongoing development work and allowing for timely profit recognition.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 4: Adapting Change Order and Additional Claim Framework for Iterative Development**\n\n**Issue Identified:** The framework for Change Orders and Additional Claims (Appendix F Definitions, Statement of the Standard, para 2/5) seems more suited to fixed-scope construction/manufacturing and may not adequately capture the iterative nature of software development or cost impacts from unforeseen technical *discoveries* inherent in R&D, rather than just external factors or Al-Mustasni's actions.\n\n**Original Text (Relevant Snippets):**\n\n*   **Appendix (F) Definitions**\n    *   **Change Orders**\n        *   Approved modifications in the specifications, quantities, design, or other attributes defined in the original Istisna\u2019a contract the implementation of which affects the contract costs.\n    *   **Additional Claims**\n        *   Amounts in excess of the agreed Istisna\u2019a contract price which are claimed by Al-Sani\u2019 for delays, errors in the specifications and designs or other causes of unanticipated costs caused by Al-Mustasni\u2019. Recognition of these claims by Al-Sani\u2019 requires the satisfaction of the following conditions:\n            *   a) The existence of a legal basis for the additional claim supported by objective and verifiable evidence.\n            *   b) Claims must be due to circumstances that were unforeseeable at the contract date and are not the result of the deficiencies, fault or negligence of Al-Sani\u2019.\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2/5 Change orders and additional claims**\n        *   a) ...\n        *   b) If requisite conditions for recognizing additional claims are met, a related amount of revenue shall be recognized equal to the additional cost caused by such claims. (para. 24)\n        *   c) If one or more requisite conditions for recognizing additional claims are not met, the estimated value of these claims shall be disclosed... (para. 25)\n        *   d) When a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists... However, the cost of change orders and additional claims are determined by the subcontractor (Al-Sani\u2019) in the parallel contract and subject to the approval of the Islamic bank. (para. 26)\n\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n\n*   **Appendix (F) Definitions**\n    *   **Change Orders**\n        *   Approved modifications in the specifications, scope, functionalities, design, or other attributes defined in the original Istisna\u2019a contract the implementation of which affects the contract price or costs. **This may include adjustments resulting from iterative development or refinements identified during the creation process, provided they are approved by Al-Mustasni\u2019.**\n    *   **Additional Claims**\n        *   Amounts in excess of the agreed Istisna\u2019a contract price which are claimed by Al-Sani\u2019 for delays, errors in the specifications and designs, **unforeseen technical challenges encountered during the creation process,** or other causes of unanticipated costs caused by Al-Mustasni\u2019. Recognition of these claims by Al-Sani\u2019 requires the satisfaction of the following conditions:\n            *   a) The existence of a contractual or legal basis for the additional claim supported by objective and verifiable evidence.\n            *   b) Claims must be due to circumstances or **technical discoveries** that were unforeseeable at the contract date and are not the result of the deficiencies, fault or negligence of Al-Sani\u2019 in executing the agreed-upon process.\n\n*   **Statement of the Standard**\n    *   **2/5 Change orders and additional claims**\n        *   a) ...\n        *   b) If requisite conditions for recognizing additional claims are met, a related amount of revenue shall be recognized equal to the additional cost caused by such claims. (para. 24)\n        *   c) If one or more requisite conditions for recognizing additional claims are not met, the estimated value of these claims shall be disclosed... (para. 25)\n        *   d) When a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists... However, the cost of change orders and additional claims are determined by the subcontractor (Al-Sani\u2019) in the parallel contract and subject to the approval of the Islamic bank. **This includes costs arising from unforeseen technical challenges or discoveries in the parallel contract, subject to the conditions in the head contract with Al-Mustasni\u2019.** (para. 26)\n\n**Rationale for Change:**\nSoftware and AI development often involve iterative processes and encountering unforeseen technical hurdles unique to the specific problem being solved. The current framework for changes and claims, while sound for traditional projects, doesn't explicitly accommodate this. The proposed changes acknowledge that change orders can arise from the *process* of development itself (iterative refinement) and that additional claims can stem from unforeseen *technical challenges* inherent in creating a novel asset, provided these are properly documented, justified, and agreed upon. This provides a more flexible yet controlled mechanism for handling scope and cost adjustments in dynamic projects, aligning the standard with the realities of modern technology development while upholding Shari'ah principles of clarity and fairness in contracts.\n\n**How it Addresses the Trigger Scenario:**\nThis addresses the dynamic nature of building a large-scale AI platform. Development often involves discovering better ways to implement features, refining algorithms based on testing, or encountering unexpected technical difficulties. The proposed changes make it clearer that adjustments resulting from these processes can be formalized as Change Orders (if approved modifications) or potentially Additional Claims (if stemming from unforeseeable technical challenges), providing a framework for managing the contract and its accounting implications through the iterative development lifecycle.\n\n---",
        "cross_standard_analysis": "Okay, here is the cross-standard impact analysis for the proposed enhancements to FAS 10, focusing on the specified AAOIFI standards.\n\n## 1. Summary of Proposed Enhancement\n\nThe proposed enhancements to FAS 10 aim to modernize the standard to better accommodate contracts for complex assets, particularly intangible ones like software and AI platforms, and projects involving significant R&D and iterative development. The key changes include:\n\n1.  **Explicitly including intangible assets** in the definition of Al-Masnoo' (the subject matter) and providing tailored guidance on how to specify their characteristics (functionality, performance, scope) instead of traditional physical attributes.\n2.  **Allowing the inclusion of integral and specific research and development costs** directly related to the creation of the contracted Al-Masnoo' within the Istisna'a contract costs, moving away from a blanket exclusion of R&D.\n3.  **Providing guidance on cost estimation for complex/intangible assets**, acknowledging the challenges but suggesting methodologies (iterative processes, frequent review) to achieve the \"reasonable accuracy\" required for the percentage-of-completion method.\n4.  **Adapting the framework for Change Orders and Additional Claims** to explicitly accommodate adjustments arising from iterative development and unforeseen technical challenges inherent in creating novel assets, providing a mechanism for managing scope and cost changes in dynamic projects.\n\nThese changes are designed to align FAS 10 with the economic reality of modern technology development and ensure Shari'ah compliance by providing clear rules for specifying and accounting for complex and intangible subject matter.\n\n## 2. Detailed Cross-Standard Impact Analysis\n\nThe proposed enhancements to FAS 10 primarily address the nature of the subject matter (tangible vs. intangible, complex/novel) and the process of its creation (involving R&D, iterative development, unforeseen challenges). While specific to Istisna'a's manufacturing/creation context, these concepts have potential implications for other standards that deal with:\n*   Intangible assets.\n*   Costs associated with creating or acquiring assets.\n*   Projects or transactions involving complex, potentially novel subject matter.\n*   Transactions where the subject matter's specification or characteristics are crucial.\n\nHere's an analysis of the impact on the selected standards:\n\n*   **FAS 4 (Musharakah Financing):**\n    *   **Impact Type:** Synergy\n    *   **Analysis:** FAS 4 deals with partnership financing where partners contribute capital, which can be in the form of tangible or *intangible* assets (Appendix D of FAS 4 mentions valuation of intangible assets). If a Musharakah is formed to *develop* a novel asset (which could be intangible), the project undertaken by the Musharakah resembles an Istisna'a process.\n        *   The enhanced guidance in FAS 10 on *specifying intangible assets* could provide a useful conceptual framework for *describing and valuing* intangible assets contributed as capital or created within a Musharakah project.\n        *   The inclusion of *directly related R&D costs* as part of the asset's cost in FAS 10 aligns with the principle that costs incurred in a Musharakah project to create an asset are part of the project's expenses before profit/loss calculation. This principle could potentially be applied within a Musharakah context focused on asset creation.\n        *   The guidance on *cost estimation for complex projects* and the framework for handling *change orders and unforeseen technical challenges* in FAS 10 are highly relevant to the management and accounting of complex Musharakah projects, especially those involving development or creation. These concepts could inform how Musharakah partners account for project costs, progress, and adjustments.\n    *   **Potential Contradictions:** No direct contradictions are apparent. The enhancements in FAS 10 seem complementary and potentially beneficial for application in relevant Musharakah scenarios.\n    *   **Potential Synergies:** High potential for synergy, particularly for Musharakah deals involving the creation or development of complex or intangible assets. The principles from enhanced FAS 10 could inform accounting treatment within the Musharakah project itself.\n\n*   **FAS 7 (Salam and Parallel Salam):**\n    *   **Impact Type:** Low/None\n    *   **Analysis:** FAS 7 deals with the forward sale of specified commodities (Al-Muslam Fihi) for advance payment (capital). The subject matter is typically fungible and tangible, deliverable at a future date.\n        *   The core requirement in Salam is the clear specification of Al-Muslam Fihi. While enhanced FAS 10 provides sophisticated guidance on specification, this is tailored for *created* or *complex* assets, particularly intangibles. Salam's subject matter (e.g., quantity and quality of grain, metal, etc.) requires a different type of specification.\n        *   R&D costs, complex cost estimation (beyond market price of inputs/commodity), and iterative development change orders are not typical features of Salam contracts.\n    *   **Potential Contradictions:** None. The nature of Salam is fundamentally different from Istisna'a in terms of subject matter and process.\n    *   **Potential Synergies:** Very low. The only loose connection is the general principle of clear subject matter specification, but the detailed guidance in enhanced FAS 10 is not applicable to typical Salam contracts.\n\n*   **FAS 28 (Murabaha and Other Deferred Payment Sales):**\n    *   **Impact Type:** Low/Medium\n    *   **Analysis:** FAS 28 deals with the sale of an *identifiable* asset on a cost-plus basis with deferred payment. The asset is typically acquired *before* being sold to the Murabaha client.\n        *   The explicit inclusion and specification guidance for *intangible assets* in enhanced FAS 10 could potentially influence discussions around the permissibility and accounting for Murabaha of intangible assets, although Murabaha's buy-then-sell structure is less naturally suited to *novel* intangibles than Istisna'a. However, it could be relevant for reselling existing intangible assets.\n        *   R&D costs are generally not relevant to Murabaha accounting, as the cost is the purchase price of the acquired asset.\n        *   Cost estimation for creation is not relevant to Murabaha accounting.\n        *   Change orders and claims in Murabaha relate more to defects or delivery issues of the *acquired* asset, not iterative development.\n    *   **Potential Contradictions:** None.\n    *   **Potential Synergies:** Low to Medium. The main potential synergy lies in providing a conceptual basis for dealing with intangible assets in a sale context, which could be relevant if Murabaha structures are applied to existing intangible assets.\n\n*   **FAS 32 (Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek):**\n    *   **Impact Type:** Medium\n    *   **Analysis:** FAS 32 deals with the leasing of the Usufruct of an identifiable asset. The asset can be tangible or intangible (e.g., lease of software licenses).\n        *   The enhanced guidance in FAS 10 on *specifying intangible assets* is directly relevant to Ijarah, as institutions lease the Usufruct of intangible assets. Clear specification of the leased intangible asset's features, scope, and performance is crucial for both Shari'ah validity and accounting (e.g., identifying the asset, determining its cost basis if acquired or created).\n        *   If an institution uses Istisna'a (or a similar process) to *create* a complex or intangible asset that it then intends to lease out under Ijarah, the cost determination principles from the enhanced FAS 10 (including relevant R&D) would establish the cost basis for the leased asset in FAS 32. Consistency in cost capitalization is important here.\n        *   While Ijarah itself doesn't involve percentage-of-completion, the underlying asset's cost determination (potentially via Istisna'a) could be complex, benefiting from the estimation guidance.\n        *   If the leased asset was custom-built via Istisna'a, the handling of change orders and claims during its creation phase (governed by enhanced FAS 10) would determine the *final specifications and cost* of the asset that enters the Ijarah portfolio. Consistency in how these adjustments affect the asset's carrying value is necessary.\n    *   **Potential Contradictions:** No direct contradictions. The principles in enhanced FAS 10 for asset creation and specification are complementary to FAS 32's need to identify and value the leased asset, especially for custom or intangible assets.\n    *   **Potential Synergies:** Medium. Strong synergy regarding the handling and specification of intangible assets, and potential synergy regarding the cost basis of custom-built assets that are subsequently leased.\n\n## 3.

Specific Recommendations for Maintaining Cross-Standard Consistency\n\n1.  **Review FAS 4 (Musharakah) and FAS 32 (Ijarah) for Alignment:** The concepts introduced in the enhanced FAS 10 regarding intangible asset specification, direct R&D capitalization in asset creation, complex cost estimation, and handling dynamic project changes are most relevant to FAS 4 (when Musharakah creates assets) and FAS 32 (when dealing with intangible or custom-built leased assets). The Accounting Board should review these standards to:\n    *   Ensure consistency in the principles for recognizing and measuring intangible assets.\n    *   Consider if explicit cross-references to the enhanced FAS 10's guidance on specification, cost estimation, and change management for complex/intangible assets would be beneficial when these concepts are relevant within Musharakah or Ijarah contexts.\n    *   Confirm that cost determination principles (including R&D capitalization) for assets created under Istisna'a are consistently applied when those assets are subsequently contributed to a Musharakah or leased under Ijarah.\n\n2.  **Consider a General Guidance Note or Framework on Intangible Assets:** Given that intangible assets are becoming increasingly important across various Islamic finance products, AAOIFI could consider developing a broader guidance note or a section within the Conceptual Framework that addresses the general principles of defining, recognizing, measuring, and specifying intangible assets, drawing upon the detailed work done in enhancing FAS 10. This could provide a consistent foundation applicable across all relevant standards (FAS 4, FAS 10, FAS 32, and potentially others in the future).\n\n3.  **Harmonize Cost Capitalization Principles:** While the enhanced FAS 10 clarifies R&D capitalization for Istisna'a, a review should ensure that cost capitalization principles for asset creation or development activities are applied consistently where they occur in other standards (e.g., within a Musharakah project).\n\n4.  **Update Definitions Consistency:** Ensure that key definitions, particularly related to intangible assets and project-related adjustments (like Change Orders, adapted for modern projects), are consistent across standards if those terms are used in similar contexts.\n\nThese recommendations aim to leverage the detailed work done in enhancing FAS 10 to improve clarity and consistency across the AAOIFI standards system, particularly concerning complex transactions and the growing importance of intangible assets.",

Specific Recommendations for Maintaining Cross-Standard Consistency\n\n1.  **Review FAS 4 (Musharakah) and FAS 32 (Ijarah) for Alignment:** The concepts introduced in the enhanced FAS 10 regarding intangible asset specification, direct R&D capitalization in asset creation, complex cost estimation, and handling dynamic project changes are most relevant to FAS 4 (when Musharakah creates assets) and FAS 32 (when dealing with intangible or custom-built leased assets). The Accounting Board should review these standards to:\n    *   Ensure consistency in the principles for recognizing and measuring intangible assets.\n    *   Consider if explicit cross-references to the enhanced FAS 10's guidance on specification, cost estimation, and change management for complex/intangible assets would be beneficial when these concepts are relevant within Musharakah or Ijarah contexts.\n    *   Confirm that cost determination principles (including R&D capitalization) for assets created under Istisna'a are consistently applied when those assets are subsequently contributed to a Musharakah or leased under Ijarah.\n\n2.  **Consider a General Guidance Note or Framework on Intangible Assets:** Given that intangible assets are becoming increasingly important across various Islamic finance products, AAOIFI could consider developing a broader guidance note or a section within the Conceptual Framework that addresses the general principles of defining, recognizing, measuring, and specifying intangible assets, drawing upon the detailed work done in enhancing FAS 10. This could provide a consistent foundation applicable across all relevant standards (FAS 4, FAS 10, FAS 32, and potentially others in the future).\n\n3.  **Harmonize Cost Capitalization Principles:** While the enhanced FAS 10 clarifies R&D capitalization for Istisna'a, a review should ensure that cost capitalization principles for asset creation or development activities are applied consistently where they occur in other standards (e.g., within a Musharakah project).\n\n4.  **Update Definitions Consistency:** Ensure that key definitions, particularly related to intangible assets and project-related adjustments (like Change Orders, adapted for modern projects), are consistent across standards if those terms are used in similar contexts.\n\nThese recommendations aim to leverage the detailed work done in enhancing FAS 10 to improve clarity and consistency across the AAOIFI standards system, particularly concerning complex transactions and the growing importance of intangible assets.",
