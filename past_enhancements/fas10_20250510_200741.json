    "review": "Okay, Standards Reviewer Agent initiating review of AAOIFI FAS 10 concerning the Istisna'a contract for a large-scale AI software platform.\n\nThe trigger scenario highlights the difficulty in applying a standard primarily designed for tangible manufacturing and construction to the development of complex intangible assets like AI software. The key areas of concern are the definition and specification of the subject matter and the determination and accounting for costs.\n\nHere is an analysis of the relevant sections from FAS 10 that may need enhancement in the context of this trigger scenario:\n\n1.  **Section/Clause:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a, Paragraph 2 (Definition); Appendix (F) Definitions, \"Istisna'a\"\n    *   **Relevant Text:** \"Istisna\u2019a is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller), whereby Al-Sani\u2019- based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured or otherwise acquired Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract) according to the specifications and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019... It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide either the raw material or the labour.\" (Appendix C, para 2)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The definition, while broad (\"manufactured or otherwise acquired\"), explicitly mentions \"raw material or the labour\" as a condition for Al-Sani'. This language is heavily rooted in tangible goods manufacturing or construction. Footnote (7) in Appendix C, para 2 states \"The subject matter may be a commodity, service or both,\" which acknowledges broader applicability, but the primary text and examples throughout the standard lean towards tangible outputs.\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the trigger scenario:** For a large-scale AI software platform, the subject matter is primarily an *intangible asset* and potentially ongoing *services* (e.g., training, maintenance). The concept of \"raw material\" is not directly applicable (unless referring metaphorically to data, but this isn't clear). While \"labour\" (developer time, expertise) is certainly provided, framing the contract around the provision of \"raw material or labour\" might feel like an awkward fit for purely intangible creation. The standard's underlying assumptions seem tied to physical production processes. This can lead to uncertainty in contract structuring and interpretation when dealing with non-physical outputs.\n\n2.  **Section/Clause:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a, Paragraph 4/1 (Al-Masnoo\u2019)\n    *   **Relevant Text:** \"Al-Masnoo\u2019 must be known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its: a) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.; b) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.; c) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications; and d) Quantity.\" (Appendix C, para 4/1/1) \"The Hanafis stipulate that the commodity contracted for ought to be of a type of items that people are used to dealing with through Istisna\u2019a.\" (Appendix C, para 4/1/2)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The examples provided (car, airplane, house) are exclusively tangible manufactured goods. While the requirement for specifications (kind, type, quality, quantity) is general, its application to a complex, potentially novel AI software platform is challenging. Defining the \"quantity\" of software is not straightforward. Defining \"quality\" often involves non-physical metrics like performance, accuracy, scalability, and user experience, which differ significantly from the \"established tables of specifications\" typically associated with physical items (e.g., building codes, material standards). The historical context in 4/1/2, linking Istisna'a legitimacy to \"customary practices\" with \"items,\" reinforces the tangible bias, even though the text later broadens the basis to *Qiyas* and *Maslaha*.\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the trigger scenario:** Clearly defining the specifications (kind, type, quality, quantity) of a large-scale AI platform upfront to remove *any* lack of knowledge is extremely difficult. Software development, especially cutting-edge AI, often involves iterative processes, evolving requirements, and unforeseen technical challenges. Translating complex functional, non-functional, and performance requirements into the standard's framework designed for physical goods' specifications can be ambiguous and potentially lead to disputes or difficulty in confirming conformity (as per Appendix C, para 9).\n\n3.  **Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, Paragraph 2/1 (Istisna\u2019a costs)\n    *   **Relevant Text:** \"Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs.\" (Statement of the Standard, para 2/1(a))\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The explicit exclusion of \"research and development costs\" from Istisna'a contract costs is a significant point of ambiguity when the subject matter *is* itself a product of research and development, such as a large-scale AI software platform.\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the trigger scenario:** Developing a large-scale AI software platform inherently involves substantial R&D efforts. These costs are not merely \"general R&D\" but are integral to creating the specific contracted asset (Al-Masnoo'). Capitalizing these direct R&D costs as part of the asset's cost is standard practice in conventional accounting for self-developed intangible assets meeting certain criteria (e.g., IAS 38). Excluding these costs under FAS 10 would significantly understate the true cost of producing the AI platform and could lead to accounting treatments that don't reflect the economic reality of the project. This creates a major conflict for financial institutions applying FAS 10 to such projects.\n\n4.  **Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, Paragraph 2/3/1 (Recognition of Istisna\u2019a revenue and profit), specifically 2/3/1/1 (Percentage-of-completion method) and 2/3/1/2 (Completed contract method)\n    *   **Relevant Text:** \"A crucial condition for applying this method [percentage-of-completion] is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy.\" (Statement of the Standard, para 2/3/1/1) \"In unusual circumstances where both the percentage of completion and the expected cost to complete the contract cannot be estimated with reasonable accuracy at the end of the financial period, no contract revenue shall be recognized until the contract is fully completed.\" (Statement of the Standard, para 2/3/1/2)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** While not a conceptual gap in the methods themselves, the *application* of the \"reasonable accuracy\" requirement for cost estimation and percentage of completion can be highly challenging for complex, novel AI software development projects compared to traditional manufacturing or construction.\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the trigger scenario:** The inherent uncertainties in large-scale AI development (e.g., algorithmic performance, data requirements, integration complexity, unforeseen technical hurdles) can make estimating total costs and the percentage of completion with \"reasonable accuracy\" very difficult, especially in earlier stages. This might force the financial institution to use the Completed Contract Method (para 2/3/1/2), which delays profit recognition until completion (which could be years away for a large AI platform), potentially misrepresenting the economic progress of the project in interim financial statements.\n\n5.  **Section/Clause:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a, Paragraph 9 (Options on Non-Compliance with Specifications)\n    *   **Relevant Text:** \"If Al-Masnoo\u2019 is not in conformity with the specifications, Al-Mustasni\u2019 has the following options: a) Reject Al-Masnoo\u2019, or b) Accept it without seeking damages.\"\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The concept of \"Reject Al-Masnoo'\" for a partially or fully developed intangible AI software platform is ambiguous. Unlike a physical item that can simply be refused, software development involves significant sunk costs (labour, infrastructure, data processing). What does rejection mean in this context? Does Al-Mustasni' walk away with nothing? Does Al-Sani' retain all intellectual property and work performed? What happens to progress payments already made?\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the trigger scenario:** If the AI platform, after significant development effort and cost, doesn't fully meet the complex specifications, the options of simple \"rejection\" or \"acceptance without damages\" may not be practical or equitable. The standard doesn't provide guidance on how these options apply to intangible assets or partially completed intangible projects, leading to potential disputes regarding the disposition of work-in-progress, intellectual property, and payments.\n\nIn summary, while AAOIFI FAS 10 provides a framework for Istisna'a, its language, examples, and specific exclusions (like R&D costs) are strongly oriented towards tangible assets. Applying it directly to complex intangible assets like large-scale AI software development exposes ambiguities and gaps, particularly regarding the definition of the subject matter, the specificity of its requirements, the inclusion of development costs (especially R&D), and the practical implications of non-compliance and rejection for intangible work-in-progress. Enhancement to explicitly address intangible assets and their unique characteristics would improve the standard's applicability and clarity for modern Islamic finance transactions involving technology and software development.",
    "proposal": "```\n# Proposal 1: Clarify Scope and Subject Matter Definition for Intangible Assets and Services\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe standard's language and examples in the definition and scope sections are heavily oriented towards tangible assets and manufacturing, creating ambiguity when applying Istisna'a contracts to intangible assets (like software) or contracts primarily involving services, despite a footnote mentioning services.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\n(From Appendix C, Juristic Rules)\n2. Definition\nIstisna\u2019a is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller), whereby Al-Sani\u2019- based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured or otherwise acquired Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract) according to the specifications and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be in advance, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time. It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide either the raw material or the labour.\n(7) The subject matter may be a commodity, service or both.\n\n(From Appendix F, Definitions)\nIstisna\u2019a\nIt is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019, (the seller) whereby Al-Sani\u2019 - based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured or otherwise acquire Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract) according to the specifications and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be at the time of contracting, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time. It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide either the raw material or the labour.\n\n(From Statement of the Standard)\n1. Scope of the Standard\nThis standard addresses the accounting rules of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a contracts in the financial statements of Islamic banks relating to measuring and recognizing the costs and revenues from Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a, the gains and losses accruing therefrom, and their presentation and disclosure in the financial statements of the Islamic bank.\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n(From Appendix C, Juristic Rules)\n2. Definition\nIstisna\u2019a is a contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller), whereby Al-Sani\u2019- based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to create, manufacture, develop or otherwise acquire Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract), which may be a tangible asset, an intangible asset, a service, or a combination thereof, according to the specifications and sell or deliver it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be in advance, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time. It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide the necessary inputs, which typically include significant labour, and may include raw material or other resources depending on the nature of Al-Masnoo\u2019.\n\n(From Appendix F, Definitions)\nIstisna\u2019a\nIt is a contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019, (the seller) whereby Al-Sani\u2019 - based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to create, manufacture, develop or otherwise acquire Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract), which may be a tangible asset, an intangible asset, a service, or a combination thereof, according to the specifications and sell or deliver it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be at the time of contracting, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time. It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide the necessary inputs, which typically include significant labour, and may include raw material or other resources depending on the nature of Al-Masnoo\u2019.\n\n(From Statement of the Standard)\n1. Scope of the Standard\nThis standard addresses the accounting rules of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a contracts in the financial statements of Islamic banks relating to measuring and recognizing the costs and revenues from Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a, the gains and losses accruing therefrom, and their presentation and disclosure in the financial statements of the Islamic bank. This includes Istisna'a contracts where the subject matter (Al-Masnoo') is a tangible asset, an intangible asset (such as software, intellectual property, etc.), a service, or a combination thereof.\n\n## Rationale\nThe original text's emphasis on \"manufactured,\" \"raw material,\" and \"labour,\" along with tangible examples, limits the perceived scope of Istisna'a in modern contexts, particularly for technology and service-based contracts. While footnote (7) exists, integrating the concept of intangible assets and services directly into the definition and scope provides clearer guidance. The proposed text explicitly includes \"create,\" \"develop,\" \"intangible asset,\" and \"service\" in the definition and scope. It also broadens the description of Al-Sani's inputs beyond just \"raw material or labour\" to \"necessary inputs, which typically include significant labour, and may include raw material or other resources,\" making it more applicable to various subject matters. This enhances the standard's relevance and clarity for a wider range of contemporary Islamic finance transactions.\n\n---\n\n# Proposal 2: Adapt Subject Matter Specifications for Intangible Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe requirements for specifying Al-Masnoo' (kind, type, quality, quantity) in Appendix C, para 4/1/1 are illustrated with tangible examples (car, house) and are difficult to apply practically to complex intangible assets like software, where \"quantity\" and \"quality\" need definition in non-physical terms.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\n(From Appendix C, Juristic Rules)\n4. Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a\n...\n4/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019\n4/1/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019 must be known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its:\na) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.;\nb) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.;\nc) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications; and\nd) Quantity.\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n(From Appendix C, Juristic Rules)\n4. Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a\n...\n4/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019\n4/1/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019 must be known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its:\na) Kind (e.g., tangible asset, intangible asset, service, software platform, building);\nb) Type (e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a residential house, an AI-powered customer service system, a financial reporting software module);\nc) Quality (e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications for tangible goods, or defined by functional requirements, performance metrics, technical standards, or service levels for intangible assets or services); and\nd) Quantity (e.g., number of units, size, capacity, number of features, user licenses, duration of service).\n4/1/2 When the subject matter is an intangible asset or service, the specifications required under 4/1/1 should be defined in a manner appropriate to its nature, clearly describing the characteristics, functionality, performance criteria, scope, and other relevant attributes necessary for Al-Mustasni\u2019 to assess conformity upon delivery or completion.\n\n## Rationale\nThe original text's examples are limited to tangible goods, leaving financial institutions uncertain how to define specifications for intangible assets like software. The proposed changes add examples of intangible assets/services under (a) and (b), and importantly, expand the definition of \"Quality\" and \"Quantity\" in (c) and (d) to include metrics relevant to intangible assets and services (e.g., performance metrics, features, service levels). A new sub-paragraph (4/1/2) is added to provide general guidance on specifying intangible assets. This provides clearer direction for contract drafting and assessment of conformity when dealing with non-physical outputs, addressing the ambiguity identified in the trigger scenario.\n\n---\n\n# Proposal 3: Allow Capitalization of Direct R&D Costs for Contracted Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nStatement of the Standard, para 2/1(a) explicitly excludes \"research and development costs\" from Istisna'a costs. This contradicts the economic reality of developing intangible assets like AI software platforms, where R&D directly creates the contracted asset and should be considered a direct cost of production, not a general expense.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\n(From Statement of the Standard)\n2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)\n2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs\na) Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs. (para. 2)\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n(From Statement of the Standard)\n2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)\n2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs\na) Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs directly attributable to creating, manufacturing, developing, or acquiring Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, and research and development costs that are not directly attributable to the specific Al-Masnoo\u2019 under the Istisna'a contract shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs. Costs incurred on research and development activities that are an integral part of creating or developing the specific Al-Masnoo\u2019 as defined in the contract's specifications shall be treated as direct costs. (para. 2)\n\n## Rationale\nThe original exclusion of all R&D costs is appropriate for general R&D that is not tied to a specific contract. However, for Istisna'a contracts where the subject matter *is* the outcome of a development process (like custom software or an AI platform), the R&D effort is a direct cost of producing the contracted asset. Excluding such costs significantly understates the asset's value and misrepresents the cost of the project. The proposed change clarifies that R&D costs *directly attributable* to the specific Al-Masnoo' defined in the contract are considered direct costs, aligning the accounting treatment with the economic substance of developing such assets under Istisna'a, while still excluding general or non-specific R&D.\n\n```",
    "validation": "Okay, Standards Validator Agent activated. I will now evaluate the proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 based on the provided criteria and documentation.\n\n**Overall Assessment Approach:**\n\nI will evaluate each proposal individually against the four validation checks:\n1.  Shariah Compliance\n2.  Internal Consistency with FAS 10\n3.  Consistency with other related AAOIFI Standards\n4.  Practical Implementability\n\nThen, I will provide a final decision for the overall proposed enhancement package.\n\n---\n\n**Validation of Proposal 1: Clarify Scope and Subject Matter Definition for Intangible Assets and Services**\n\n*   **Proposal Summary:** Modify the definition of Istisna'a in Appendix C and F, and the Scope in the Statement of the Standard, to explicitly include intangible assets (like software) and services as potential subject matter (Al-Masnoo'), broadening the description of Al-Sani's inputs.\n\n*   **1. Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** Istisna'a is a contract whose legitimacy is based on `Istihsan` (juristic approbation) or `Qiyas` and `Maslaha` (public good/common need), as noted in FAS 10 Appendix C, para 3. The core requirement is the *creation* or *acquisition* of a specified subject matter by Al-Sani' for Al-Mustasni'. The original text already acknowledges that the subject matter \"may be a commodity, service or both\" in Appendix C, para 2, footnote (7). This explicitly permits services. Shariah does not prohibit the creation or sale of valuable intangible assets (like intellectual property, software, etc.), provided they are not related to prohibited activities (`haram`). The proposed enhancement merely makes this explicit in the main body of the standard's definition and scope, bringing the standard's language in line with the existing juristic understanding already noted in a footnote and the evolving nature of economic transactions. It does not introduce Riba (fixed, predetermined interest), Gharar (excessive uncertainty, addressed further in Proposal 2), or Maysir (gambling). The contract remains one of sale for a specified, to-be-created item/service.\n    *   **Assessment:** Complies with core Shariah principles.\n\n*   **2. Consistency Check (Internal & Other Standards):**\n    *   **Reasoning:**\n        *   **Internal Consistency (FAS 10):** The proposal is consistent with and builds upon the existing footnote (7) in Appendix C, para 2, which already states the subject matter can be a commodity, service, or both. Integrating this into the main definition and scope clarifies the standard's intent. It also sets the necessary foundation for Proposal 2, which addresses *how* to specify these subject matters.\n        *   **Consistency with Other Standards:** Other AAOIFI standards recognize intangible assets. For example, FAS 4 (Musharaka Financing) Appendix D mentions the possibility of contributed capital being in the form of \"real or intangible assets,\" requiring their valuation. This demonstrates that AAOIFI recognizes intangible assets as valid subjects in Islamic finance contracts. Extending Istisna'a to the *creation* of such assets aligns with this broader recognition.\n    *   **Assessment:** Consistent with FAS 10 and other related standards.\n\n*   **3. Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This enhancement significantly improves the practicality of using Istisna'a for modern financing needs. Software development, custom service platforms, intellectual property creation, etc., are common transactions. Explicitly including them within the scope of FAS 10 provides necessary clarity for financial institutions and auditors, reducing uncertainty about how to structure and account for such contracts under Islamic finance principles. It addresses the \"uncertainty\" identified in the trigger scenario.\n    *   **Assessment:** Practical and necessary for modern transactions.\n\n*   **4. Final Decision for Proposal 1:** APPROVED.\n\n---\n\n**Validation of Proposal 2: Adapt Subject Matter Specifications for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Proposal Summary:** Modify Appendix C, para 4/1/1, which details the required specifications for Al-Masnoo' (Kind, Type, Quality, Quantity), by adding examples relevant to intangible assets and services and introducing a new sub-paragraph (4/1/2) providing general guidance on specifying non-tangible subject matter.\n\n*   **1. Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The Shariah requirement in Istisna'a (and Salam) to precisely specify the subject matter is fundamental to avoiding `Gharar` (excessive uncertainty). Appendix C, para 4/1/1 outlines the means (Kind, Type, Quality, Quantity) to achieve this. The original examples are geared towards tangible goods because Istisna'a historically applied to manufacturing physical items. However, the *principle* is to remove uncertainty about *what* is being contracted for, enabling both parties to know their rights and obligations and for Al-Mustasni' to assess conformity upon delivery. For intangible assets and services, \"Quality\" is defined by functional requirements, performance, standards, etc., and \"Quantity\" by features, users, duration, etc. This proposal directly applies the Shariah principle of `Gharar` avoidance to the context of intangible assets and services by providing relevant, practical methods for specification. The new sub-paragraph 4/1/2 reinforces the need for clear definition appropriate to the subject matter's nature. This does not introduce Riba or Maysir.\n    *   **Assessment:** Complies with core Shariah principles, specifically by providing practical means to address the `Gharar` requirement for intangible subject matter.\n\n*   **2. Consistency Check (Internal & Other Standards):**\n    *   **Reasoning:**\n        *   **Internal Consistency (FAS 10):** This proposal is a direct consequence of Proposal 1 (assuming it's approved). If intangible assets and services are within scope, the standard *must* provide guidance on how to meet the existing specification requirements (para 4/1/1) for these types of subject matter. It maintains the structure of the original requirements while expanding their applicability.\n        *   **Consistency with Other Standards:** Other standards (like Salam, FAS 7) also require specification of the subject matter (`Al-Muslam Fihi`), typically commodities. The principle of clear specification is consistent across forward sale-type contracts. Adapting the *method* of specification based on the *nature* of the asset is a logical extension of this principle.\n    *   **Assessment:** Consistent with FAS 10 (especially in conjunction with Proposal 1) and the general principle of specification in forward contracts.\n\n*   **3. Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is highly practical. It provides financial institutions and legal practitioners with concrete examples and guidance on how to draft Istisna'a contracts for software development, service projects, etc. Without this clarity, applying the standard's specification requirements to non-tangible assets would be highly ambiguous, hindering the use of Istisna'a for such transactions. It directly addresses the uncertainty regarding specification for software development mentioned in the trigger scenario.\n    *   **Assessment:** Highly practical and necessary for implementation with non-tangible assets.\n\n*   **4. Final Decision for Proposal 2:** APPROVED.\n\n---\n\n**Validation of Proposal 3: Allow Capitalization of Direct R&D Costs for Contracted Assets**\n\n*   **Proposal Summary:** Modify Statement of the Standard, para 2/1(a) to allow research and development costs that are *directly attributable* to the specific Al-Masnoo' under the Istisna'a contract (as defined by its specifications) to be included as direct costs, while still excluding general R&D and other non-attributable expenses.\n\n*   **1. Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This proposal concerns the *accounting treatment* of costs incurred by Al-Sani' (the Islamic bank or its contractor) in fulfilling the Istisna'a contract. Shariah principles primarily govern the validity of the underlying transaction structure, not the specific accounting methods, provided these methods do not facilitate or conceal prohibited elements (Riba, Gharar, Maysir) or misrepresent the nature of the transaction to the detriment of stakeholders (lack of transparency/fairness). The original exclusion of *all* R&D costs likely stems from accounting conservatism, as R&D outcomes can be uncertain, or the R&D is general and benefits future projects. However, in the context of a bespoke Istisna'a contract for developing a unique asset (like custom software or an AI platform), the development effort *is* the production process. Costs directly incurred in this specific development are economically the cost of creating that asset. Capitalizing direct production costs is a standard accounting practice for long-term contracts like Istisna'a (reflected in the \"Istisna'a work-in-progress account\" mentioned in para 2/1(b)). Allowing capitalization of R&D costs *directly attributable* to the contracted asset aligns the accounting cost with the economic substance of creating the asset. This does not introduce Riba, Gharar, or Maysir into the Istisna'a contract itself. It's a matter of cost allocation and recognition for financial reporting.\n    *   **Assessment:** Complies with core Shariah principles, as it relates to accounting treatment and aligns with the economic reality of creating a bespoke asset under Istisna'a.\n\n*   **2. Consistency Check (Internal & Other Standards):**\n    *   **Reasoning:**\n        *   **Internal Consistency (FAS 10):** The proposal refines, rather than contradicts, the concept of \"Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo'\" in para 2/1(a). It clarifies that for certain types of Al-Masnoo' (especially intangible ones created through development), the direct costs of production include the specific R&D required to meet the contract's specifications. It makes the cost accounting section more consistent with the broadened scope and subject matter definitions proposed in Proposals 1 and 2. Capitalizing costs of production is consistent with the use of a \"work-in-progress\" account (para 2/1(b)).\n        *   **Consistency with Other Standards:** Conventional accounting standards (like IAS 38) distinguish between research (often expensed) and development (potentially capitalized if criteria are met). While AAOIFI standards may not always mirror IFRS/FASB, aligning accounting treatment of bespoke development costs with the asset being created is a sound accounting principle. FAS 4 recognizes intangible assets can be contributed as capital, implying their value (and thus potentially their cost of creation) can be recognized. This proposal is specific to Istisna'a costs for the Sani' and seems justifiable within that specific context.\n    *   **Assessment:** Consistent with the purpose of Istisna'a cost accounting and aligns with the economic reality of bespoke development.\n\n*   **3. Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is crucial for practical implementation, especially for Istisna'a contracts involving complex intangible assets like software or AI platforms. Developing such assets inherently involves activities conventionally labelled \"R&D.\" If all such costs are expensed regardless of whether they are directly tied to a specific, contracted-for asset, the cost of the Istisna'a project would be significantly understated, distorting the financial statements (e.g., understating assets and overstating expenses during the development phase, leading to misrepresentation of project profitability). Allowing capitalization of direct R&D provides a more accurate reflection of the economic investment in creating the contracted asset. It does require robust internal controls to track and allocate costs accurately, distinguishing direct from general R&D, but this is a standard accounting challenge.\n    *   **Assessment:** Highly practical and necessary for accurate financial reporting of Istisna'a contracts involving significant development effort.\n\n*   **4. Final Decision for Proposal 3:** APPROVED.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nAll three proposed enhancements address genuine ambiguities in the current FAS 10 when applied to contemporary transactions involving intangible assets and services, such as the AI software platform mentioned in the trigger scenario.\n\n*   Proposal 1 explicitly brings intangible assets and services into the scope and definition, which is consistent with an existing footnote and the broader recognition of intangible assets in other AAOIFI standards.\n*   Proposal 2 provides practical and Shariah-compliant guidance on how to specify these non-tangible subject matters, directly addressing the `Gharar` concern in a modern context.\n*   Proposal 3 allows for more accurate accounting of the costs of creating bespoke intangible assets under Istisna'a by permitting capitalization of direct R&D, aligning accounting with economic substance without violating core Shariah principles.\n\nTogether, these proposals significantly improve the clarity, relevance, and practical applicability of AAOIFI FAS 10 for a wider range of contemporary Islamic finance activities, particularly in the technology and service sectors. They do so while upholding the fundamental Shariah principles governing Istisna'a contracts.\n\n**Final Decision:** APPROVED.\n\n**Detailed Reasoning:** The proposed enhancements are well-reasoned and directly address the practical challenges faced by financial institutions applying FAS 10 to intangible assets and services. They are consistent with the underlying Shariah principles of Istisna'a (particularly the need to avoid Gharar through specification and the permissibility based on Maslaha), align with the existing recognition of services and, by extension, intangible assets within the standard's juristic basis and other AAOIFI standards, and provide necessary clarity for practical implementation and accurate financial reporting. The changes enhance the standard's ability to facilitate Shariah-compliant financing for modern economic activities.",

        "review_analysis": "Okay, Standards Reviewer Agent initiating review of AAOIFI FAS 10 concerning the Istisna'a contract for a large-scale AI software platform.\n\nThe trigger scenario highlights the difficulty in applying a standard primarily designed for tangible manufacturing and construction to the development of complex intangible assets like AI software. The key areas of concern are the definition and specification of the subject matter and the determination and accounting for costs.\n\nHere is an analysis of the relevant sections from FAS 10 that may need enhancement in the context of this trigger scenario:\n\n1.  **Section/Clause:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a, Paragraph 2 (Definition); Appendix (F) Definitions, \"Istisna'a\"\n    *   **Relevant Text:** \"Istisna\u2019a is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller), whereby Al-Sani\u2019- based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured or otherwise acquired Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract) according to the specifications and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019... It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide either the raw material or the labour.\" (Appendix C, para 2)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The definition, while broad (\"manufactured or otherwise acquired\"), explicitly mentions \"raw material or the labour\" as a condition for Al-Sani'. This language is heavily rooted in tangible goods manufacturing or construction. Footnote (7) in Appendix C, para 2 states \"The subject matter may be a commodity, service or both,\" which acknowledges broader applicability, but the primary text and examples throughout the standard lean towards tangible outputs.\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the trigger scenario:** For a large-scale AI software platform, the subject matter is primarily an *intangible asset* and potentially ongoing *services* (e.g., training, maintenance). The concept of \"raw material\" is not directly applicable (unless referring metaphorically to data, but this isn't clear). While \"labour\" (developer time, expertise) is certainly provided, framing the contract around the provision of \"raw material or labour\" might feel like an awkward fit for purely intangible creation. The standard's underlying assumptions seem tied to physical production processes. This can lead to uncertainty in contract structuring and interpretation when dealing with non-physical outputs.\n\n2.  **Section/Clause:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a, Paragraph 4/1 (Al-Masnoo\u2019)\n    *   **Relevant Text:** \"Al-Masnoo\u2019 must be known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its: a) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.; b) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.; c) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications; and d) Quantity.\" (Appendix C, para 4/1/1) \"The Hanafis stipulate that the commodity contracted for ought to be of a type of items that people are used to dealing with through Istisna\u2019a.\" (Appendix C, para 4/1/2)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The examples provided (car, airplane, house) are exclusively tangible manufactured goods. While the requirement for specifications (kind, type, quality, quantity) is general, its application to a complex, potentially novel AI software platform is challenging. Defining the \"quantity\" of software is not straightforward. Defining \"quality\" often involves non-physical metrics like performance, accuracy, scalability, and user experience, which differ significantly from the \"established tables of specifications\" typically associated with physical items (e.g., building codes, material standards). The historical context in 4/1/2, linking Istisna'a legitimacy to \"customary practices\" with \"items,\" reinforces the tangible bias, even though the text later broadens the basis to *Qiyas* and *Maslaha*.\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the trigger scenario:** Clearly defining the specifications (kind, type, quality, quantity) of a large-scale AI platform upfront to remove *any* lack of knowledge is extremely difficult. Software development, especially cutting-edge AI, often involves iterative processes, evolving requirements, and unforeseen technical challenges. Translating complex functional, non-functional, and performance requirements into the standard's framework designed for physical goods' specifications can be ambiguous and potentially lead to disputes or difficulty in confirming conformity (as per Appendix C, para 9).\n\n3.  **Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, Paragraph 2/1 (Istisna\u2019a costs)\n    *   **Relevant Text:** \"Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs.\" (Statement of the Standard, para 2/1(a))\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The explicit exclusion of \"research and development costs\" from Istisna'a contract costs is a significant point of ambiguity when the subject matter *is* itself a product of research and development, such as a large-scale AI software platform.\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the trigger scenario:** Developing a large-scale AI software platform inherently involves substantial R&D efforts. These costs are not merely \"general R&D\" but are integral to creating the specific contracted asset (Al-Masnoo'). Capitalizing these direct R&D costs as part of the asset's cost is standard practice in conventional accounting for self-developed intangible assets meeting certain criteria (e.g., IAS 38). Excluding these costs under FAS 10 would significantly understate the true cost of producing the AI platform and could lead to accounting treatments that don't reflect the economic reality of the project. This creates a major conflict for financial institutions applying FAS 10 to such projects.\n\n4.  **Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, Paragraph 2/3/1 (Recognition of Istisna\u2019a revenue and profit), specifically 2/3/1/1 (Percentage-of-completion method) and 2/3/1/2 (Completed contract method)\n    *   **Relevant Text:** \"A crucial condition for applying this method [percentage-of-completion] is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy.\" (Statement of the Standard, para 2/3/1/1) \"In unusual circumstances where both the percentage of completion and the expected cost to complete the contract cannot be estimated with reasonable accuracy at the end of the financial period, no contract revenue shall be recognized until the contract is fully completed.\" (Statement of the Standard, para 2/3/1/2)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** While not a conceptual gap in the methods themselves, the *application* of the \"reasonable accuracy\" requirement for cost estimation and percentage of completion can be highly challenging for complex, novel AI software development projects compared to traditional manufacturing or construction.\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the trigger scenario:** The inherent uncertainties in large-scale AI development (e.g., algorithmic performance, data requirements, integration complexity, unforeseen technical hurdles) can make estimating total costs and the percentage of completion with \"reasonable accuracy\" very difficult, especially in earlier stages. This might force the financial institution to use the Completed Contract Method (para 2/3/1/2), which delays profit recognition until completion (which could be years away for a large AI platform), potentially misrepresenting the economic progress of the project in interim financial statements.\n\n5.  **Section/Clause:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a, Paragraph 9 (Options on Non-Compliance with Specifications)\n    *   **Relevant Text:** \"If Al-Masnoo\u2019 is not in conformity with the specifications, Al-Mustasni\u2019 has the following options: a) Reject Al-Masnoo\u2019, or b) Accept it without seeking damages.\"\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The concept of \"Reject Al-Masnoo'\" for a partially or fully developed intangible AI software platform is ambiguous.

        "review_analysis": "Okay, Standards Reviewer Agent initiating review of AAOIFI FAS 10 concerning the Istisna'a contract for a large-scale AI software platform.\n\nThe trigger scenario highlights the difficulty in applying a standard primarily designed for tangible manufacturing and construction to the development of complex intangible assets like AI software. The key areas of concern are the definition and specification of the subject matter and the determination and accounting for costs.\n\nHere is an analysis of the relevant sections from FAS 10 that may need enhancement in the context of this trigger scenario:\n\n1.  **Section/Clause:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a, Paragraph 2 (Definition); Appendix (F) Definitions, \"Istisna'a\"\n    *   **Relevant Text:** \"Istisna\u2019a is a sale contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller), whereby Al-Sani\u2019- based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to have manufactured or otherwise acquired Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract) according to the specifications and sell it to Al-Mustasni\u2019... It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide either the raw material or the labour.\" (Appendix C, para 2)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The definition, while broad (\"manufactured or otherwise acquired\"), explicitly mentions \"raw material or the labour\" as a condition for Al-Sani'. This language is heavily rooted in tangible goods manufacturing or construction. Footnote (7) in Appendix C, para 2 states \"The subject matter may be a commodity, service or both,\" which acknowledges broader applicability, but the primary text and examples throughout the standard lean towards tangible outputs.\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the trigger scenario:** For a large-scale AI software platform, the subject matter is primarily an *intangible asset* and potentially ongoing *services* (e.g., training, maintenance). The concept of \"raw material\" is not directly applicable (unless referring metaphorically to data, but this isn't clear). While \"labour\" (developer time, expertise) is certainly provided, framing the contract around the provision of \"raw material or labour\" might feel like an awkward fit for purely intangible creation. The standard's underlying assumptions seem tied to physical production processes. This can lead to uncertainty in contract structuring and interpretation when dealing with non-physical outputs.\n\n2.  **Section/Clause:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a, Paragraph 4/1 (Al-Masnoo\u2019)\n    *   **Relevant Text:** \"Al-Masnoo\u2019 must be known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its: a) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.; b) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.; c) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications; and d) Quantity.\" (Appendix C, para 4/1/1) \"The Hanafis stipulate that the commodity contracted for ought to be of a type of items that people are used to dealing with through Istisna\u2019a.\" (Appendix C, para 4/1/2)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The examples provided (car, airplane, house) are exclusively tangible manufactured goods. While the requirement for specifications (kind, type, quality, quantity) is general, its application to a complex, potentially novel AI software platform is challenging. Defining the \"quantity\" of software is not straightforward. Defining \"quality\" often involves non-physical metrics like performance, accuracy, scalability, and user experience, which differ significantly from the \"established tables of specifications\" typically associated with physical items (e.g., building codes, material standards). The historical context in 4/1/2, linking Istisna'a legitimacy to \"customary practices\" with \"items,\" reinforces the tangible bias, even though the text later broadens the basis to *Qiyas* and *Maslaha*.\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the trigger scenario:** Clearly defining the specifications (kind, type, quality, quantity) of a large-scale AI platform upfront to remove *any* lack of knowledge is extremely difficult. Software development, especially cutting-edge AI, often involves iterative processes, evolving requirements, and unforeseen technical challenges. Translating complex functional, non-functional, and performance requirements into the standard's framework designed for physical goods' specifications can be ambiguous and potentially lead to disputes or difficulty in confirming conformity (as per Appendix C, para 9).\n\n3.  **Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, Paragraph 2/1 (Istisna\u2019a costs)\n    *   **Relevant Text:** \"Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs.\" (Statement of the Standard, para 2/1(a))\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The explicit exclusion of \"research and development costs\" from Istisna'a contract costs is a significant point of ambiguity when the subject matter *is* itself a product of research and development, such as a large-scale AI software platform.\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the trigger scenario:** Developing a large-scale AI software platform inherently involves substantial R&D efforts. These costs are not merely \"general R&D\" but are integral to creating the specific contracted asset (Al-Masnoo'). Capitalizing these direct R&D costs as part of the asset's cost is standard practice in conventional accounting for self-developed intangible assets meeting certain criteria (e.g., IAS 38). Excluding these costs under FAS 10 would significantly understate the true cost of producing the AI platform and could lead to accounting treatments that don't reflect the economic reality of the project. This creates a major conflict for financial institutions applying FAS 10 to such projects.\n\n4.  **Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, Paragraph 2/3/1 (Recognition of Istisna\u2019a revenue and profit), specifically 2/3/1/1 (Percentage-of-completion method) and 2/3/1/2 (Completed contract method)\n    *   **Relevant Text:** \"A crucial condition for applying this method [percentage-of-completion] is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy.\" (Statement of the Standard, para 2/3/1/1) \"In unusual circumstances where both the percentage of completion and the expected cost to complete the contract cannot be estimated with reasonable accuracy at the end of the financial period, no contract revenue shall be recognized until the contract is fully completed.\" (Statement of the Standard, para 2/3/1/2)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** While not a conceptual gap in the methods themselves, the *application* of the \"reasonable accuracy\" requirement for cost estimation and percentage of completion can be highly challenging for complex, novel AI software development projects compared to traditional manufacturing or construction.\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the trigger scenario:** The inherent uncertainties in large-scale AI development (e.g., algorithmic performance, data requirements, integration complexity, unforeseen technical hurdles) can make estimating total costs and the percentage of completion with \"reasonable accuracy\" very difficult, especially in earlier stages. This might force the financial institution to use the Completed Contract Method (para 2/3/1/2), which delays profit recognition until completion (which could be years away for a large AI platform), potentially misrepresenting the economic progress of the project in interim financial statements.\n\n5.  **Section/Clause:** Appendix (C) Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a, Paragraph 9 (Options on Non-Compliance with Specifications)\n    *   **Relevant Text:** \"If Al-Masnoo\u2019 is not in conformity with the specifications, Al-Mustasni\u2019 has the following options: a) Reject Al-Masnoo\u2019, or b) Accept it without seeking damages.\"\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The concept of \"Reject Al-Masnoo'\" for a partially or fully developed intangible AI software platform is ambiguous. Unlike a physical item that can simply be refused, software development involves significant sunk costs (labour, infrastructure, data processing). What does rejection mean in this context? Does Al-Mustasni' walk away with nothing? Does Al-Sani' retain all intellectual property and work performed? What happens to progress payments already made?\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the trigger scenario:** If the AI platform, after significant development effort and cost, doesn't fully meet the complex specifications, the options of simple \"rejection\" or \"acceptance without damages\" may not be practical or equitable. The standard doesn't provide guidance on how these options apply to intangible assets or partially completed intangible projects, leading to potential disputes regarding the disposition of work-in-progress, intellectual property, and payments.\n\nIn summary, while AAOIFI FAS 10 provides a framework for Istisna'a, its language, examples, and specific exclusions (like R&D costs) are strongly oriented towards tangible assets.

Definition\nIstisna\u2019a is a contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019 (the seller), whereby Al-Sani\u2019- based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to create, manufacture, develop or otherwise acquire Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract), which may be a tangible asset, an intangible asset, a service, or a combination thereof, according to the specifications and sell or deliver it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be in advance, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time. It is a condition of the Istisna\u2019a contract that Al-Sani\u2019 should provide the necessary inputs, which typically include significant labour, and may include raw material or other resources depending on the nature of Al-Masnoo\u2019.\n\n(From Appendix F, Definitions)\nIstisna\u2019a\nIt is a contract between Al-Mustasni\u2019 (the buyer) and Al-Sani\u2019, (the seller) whereby Al-Sani\u2019 - based on an order from Al-Mustasni\u2019- undertakes to create, manufacture, develop or otherwise acquire Al-Masnoo\u2019 (the subject matter of the contract), which may be a tangible asset, an intangible asset, a service, or a combination thereof, according to the specifications and sell or deliver it to Al-Mustasni\u2019 for an agreed upon price and method of settlement whether that be at the time of contracting, by instalments or deferred to a specific future time.

This includes Istisna'a contracts where the subject matter (Al-Masnoo') is a tangible asset, an intangible asset (such as software, intellectual property, etc.), a service, or a combination thereof.\n\n## Rationale\nThe original text's emphasis on \"manufactured,\" \"raw material,\" and \"labour,\" along with tangible examples, limits the perceived scope of Istisna'a in modern contexts, particularly for technology and service-based contracts. While footnote (7) exists, integrating the concept of intangible assets and services directly into the definition and scope provides clearer guidance. The proposed text explicitly includes \"create,\" \"develop,\" \"intangible asset,\" and \"service\" in the definition and scope. It also broadens the description of Al-Sani's inputs beyond just \"raw material or labour\" to \"necessary inputs, which typically include significant labour, and may include raw material or other resources,\" making it more applicable to various subject matters. This enhances the standard's relevance and clarity for a wider range of contemporary Islamic finance transactions.\n\n---\n\n# Proposal 2: Adapt Subject Matter Specifications for Intangible Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe requirements for specifying Al-Masnoo' (kind, type, quality, quantity) in Appendix C, para 4/1/1 are illustrated with tangible examples (car, house) and are difficult to apply practically to complex intangible assets like software, where \"quantity\" and \"quality\" need definition in non-physical terms.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\n(From Appendix C, Juristic Rules)\n4.

The proposed changes add examples of intangible assets/services under (a) and (b), and importantly, expand the definition of \"Quality\" and \"Quantity\" in (c) and (d) to include metrics relevant to intangible assets and services (e.g., performance metrics, features, service levels). A new sub-paragraph (4/1/2) is added to provide general guidance on specifying intangible assets. This provides clearer direction for contract drafting and assessment of conformity when dealing with non-physical outputs, addressing the ambiguity identified in the trigger scenario.\n\n---\n\n# Proposal 3: Allow Capitalization of Direct R&D Costs for Contracted Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nStatement of the Standard, para 2/1(a) explicitly excludes \"research and development costs\" from Istisna'a costs. This contradicts the economic reality of developing intangible assets like AI software platforms, where R&D directly creates the contracted asset and should be considered a direct cost of production, not a general expense.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\n(From Statement of the Standard)\n2.

General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, and research and development costs that are not directly attributable to the specific Al-Masnoo\u2019 under the Istisna'a contract shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs. Costs incurred on research and development activities that are an integral part of creating or developing the specific Al-Masnoo\u2019 as defined in the contract's specifications shall be treated as direct costs. (para. 2)\n\n## Rationale\nThe original exclusion of all R&D costs is appropriate for general R&D that is not tied to a specific contract. However, for Istisna'a contracts where the subject matter *is* the outcome of a development process (like custom software or an AI platform), the R&D effort is a direct cost of producing the contracted asset. Excluding such costs significantly understates the asset's value and misrepresents the cost of the project. The proposed change clarifies that R&D costs *directly attributable* to the specific Al-Masnoo' defined in the contract are considered direct costs, aligning the accounting treatment with the economic substance of developing such assets under Istisna'a, while still excluding general or non-specific R&D.\n\n```"

A new sub-paragraph (4/1/2) is added to provide general guidance on specifying intangible assets. This provides clearer direction for contract drafting and assessment of conformity when dealing with non-physical outputs, addressing the ambiguity identified in the trigger scenario.\n\n---\n\n# Proposal 3: Allow Capitalization of Direct R&D Costs for Contracted Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nStatement of the Standard, para 2/1(a) explicitly excludes \"research and development costs\" from Istisna'a costs. This contradicts the economic reality of developing intangible assets like AI software platforms, where R&D directly creates the contracted asset and should be considered a direct cost of production, not a general expense.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\n(From Statement of the Standard)\n2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)\n2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs\na) Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs. (para. 2)\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\n(From Statement of the Standard)\n2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)\n2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs\na) Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs directly attributable to creating, manufacturing, developing, or acquiring Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, and research and development costs that are not directly attributable to the specific Al-Masnoo\u2019 under the Istisna'a contract shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs. Costs incurred on research and development activities that are an integral part of creating or developing the specific Al-Masnoo\u2019 as defined in the contract's specifications shall be treated as direct costs. (para. 2)\n\n## Rationale\nThe original exclusion of all R&D costs is appropriate for general R&D that is not tied to a specific contract. However, for Istisna'a contracts where the subject matter *is* the outcome of a development process (like custom software or an AI platform), the R&D effort is a direct cost of producing the contracted asset. Excluding such costs significantly understates the asset's value and misrepresents the cost of the project. The proposed change clarifies that R&D costs *directly attributable* to the specific Al-Masnoo' defined in the contract are considered direct costs, aligning the accounting treatment with the economic substance of developing such assets under Istisna'a, while still excluding general or non-specific R&D.\n\n```",
        "validation_result": "Okay, Standards Validator Agent activated. I will now evaluate the proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 based on the provided criteria and documentation.\n\n**Overall Assessment Approach:**\n\nI will evaluate each proposal individually against the four validation checks:\n1.  Shariah Compliance\n2.  Internal Consistency with FAS 10\n3.  Consistency with other related AAOIFI Standards\n4.  Practical Implementability\n\nThen, I will provide a final decision for the overall proposed enhancement package.\n\n---\n\n**Validation of Proposal 1: Clarify Scope and Subject Matter Definition for Intangible Assets and Services**\n\n*   **Proposal Summary:** Modify the definition of Istisna'a in Appendix C and F, and the Scope in the Statement of the Standard, to explicitly include intangible assets (like software) and services as potential subject matter (Al-Masnoo'), broadening the description of Al-Sani's inputs.\n\n*   **1. Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** Istisna'a is a contract whose legitimacy is based on `Istihsan` (juristic approbation) or `Qiyas` and `Maslaha` (public good/common need), as noted in FAS 10 Appendix C, para 3. The core requirement is the *creation* or *acquisition* of a specified subject matter by Al-Sani' for Al-Mustasni'. The original text already acknowledges that the subject matter \"may be a commodity, service or both\" in Appendix C, para 2, footnote (7). This explicitly permits services. Shariah does not prohibit the creation or sale of valuable intangible assets (like intellectual property, software, etc.), provided they are not related to prohibited activities (`haram`). The proposed enhancement merely makes this explicit in the main body of the standard's definition and scope, bringing the standard's language in line with the existing juristic understanding already noted in a footnote and the evolving nature of economic transactions. It does not introduce Riba (fixed, predetermined interest), Gharar (excessive uncertainty, addressed further in Proposal 2), or Maysir (gambling). The contract remains one of sale for a specified, to-be-created item/service.\n    *   **Assessment:** Complies with core Shariah principles.\n\n*   **2. Consistency Check (Internal & Other Standards):**\n    *   **Reasoning:**\n        *   **Internal Consistency (FAS 10):** The proposal is consistent with and builds upon the existing footnote (7) in Appendix C, para 2, which already states the subject matter can be a commodity, service, or both. Integrating this into the main definition and scope clarifies the standard's intent. It also sets the necessary foundation for Proposal 2, which addresses *how* to specify these subject matters.\n        *   **Consistency with Other Standards:** Other AAOIFI standards recognize intangible assets. For example, FAS 4 (Musharaka Financing) Appendix D mentions the possibility of contributed capital being in the form of \"real or intangible assets,\" requiring their valuation. This demonstrates that AAOIFI recognizes intangible assets as valid subjects in Islamic finance contracts. Extending Istisna'a to the *creation* of such assets aligns with this broader recognition.\n    *   **Assessment:** Consistent with FAS 10 and other related standards.\n\n*   **3. Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This enhancement significantly improves the practicality of using Istisna'a for modern financing needs. Software development, custom service platforms, intellectual property creation, etc., are common transactions. Explicitly including them within the scope of FAS 10 provides necessary clarity for financial institutions and auditors, reducing uncertainty about how to structure and account for such contracts under Islamic finance principles. It addresses the \"uncertainty\" identified in the trigger scenario.\n    *   **Assessment:** Practical and necessary for modern transactions.\n\n*   **4. Final Decision for Proposal 1:** APPROVED.\n\n---\n\n**Validation of Proposal 2: Adapt Subject Matter Specifications for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Proposal Summary:** Modify Appendix C, para 4/1/1, which details the required specifications for Al-Masnoo' (Kind, Type, Quality, Quantity), by adding examples relevant to intangible assets and services and introducing a new sub-paragraph (4/1/2) providing general guidance on specifying non-tangible subject matter.\n\n*   **1. Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The Shariah requirement in Istisna'a (and Salam) to precisely specify the subject matter is fundamental to avoiding `Gharar` (excessive uncertainty). Appendix C, para 4/1/1 outlines the means (Kind, Type, Quality, Quantity) to achieve this. The original examples are geared towards tangible goods because Istisna'a historically applied to manufacturing physical items. However, the *principle* is to remove uncertainty about *what* is being contracted for, enabling both parties to know their rights and obligations and for Al-Mustasni' to assess conformity upon delivery. For intangible assets and services, \"Quality\" is defined by functional requirements, performance, standards, etc., and \"Quantity\" by features, users, duration, etc. This proposal directly applies the Shariah principle of `Gharar` avoidance to the context of intangible assets and services by providing relevant, practical methods for specification. The new sub-paragraph 4/1/2 reinforces the need for clear definition appropriate to the subject matter's nature. This does not introduce Riba or Maysir.\n    *   **Assessment:** Complies with core Shariah principles, specifically by providing practical means to address the `Gharar` requirement for intangible subject matter.\n\n*   **2. Consistency Check (Internal & Other Standards):**\n    *   **Reasoning:**\n        *   **Internal Consistency (FAS 10):** This proposal is a direct consequence of Proposal 1 (assuming it's approved). If intangible assets and services are within scope, the standard *must* provide guidance on how to meet the existing specification requirements (para 4/1/1) for these types of subject matter. It maintains the structure of the original requirements while expanding their applicability.\n        *   **Consistency with Other Standards:** Other standards (like Salam, FAS 7) also require specification of the subject matter (`Al-Muslam Fihi`), typically commodities. The principle of clear specification is consistent across forward sale-type contracts. Adapting the *method* of specification based on the *nature* of the asset is a logical extension of this principle.\n    *   **Assessment:** Consistent with FAS 10 (especially in conjunction with Proposal 1) and the general principle of specification in forward contracts.\n\n*   **3. Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is highly practical. It provides financial institutions and legal practitioners with concrete examples and guidance on how to draft Istisna'a contracts for software development, service projects, etc. Without this clarity, applying the standard's specification requirements to non-tangible assets would be highly ambiguous, hindering the use of Istisna'a for such transactions. It directly addresses the uncertainty regarding specification for software development mentioned in the trigger scenario.\n    *   **Assessment:** Highly practical and necessary for implementation with non-tangible assets.\n\n*   **4. Final Decision for Proposal 2:** APPROVED.\n\n---\n\n**Validation of Proposal 3: Allow Capitalization of Direct R&D Costs for Contracted Assets**\n\n*   **Proposal Summary:** Modify Statement of the Standard, para 2/1(a) to allow research and development costs that are *directly attributable* to the specific Al-Masnoo' under the Istisna'a contract (as defined by its specifications) to be included as direct costs, while still excluding general R&D and other non-attributable expenses.\n\n*   **1. Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This proposal concerns the *accounting treatment* of costs incurred by Al-Sani' (the Islamic bank or its contractor) in fulfilling the Istisna'a contract. Shariah principles primarily govern the validity of the underlying transaction structure, not the specific accounting methods, provided these methods do not facilitate or conceal prohibited elements (Riba, Gharar, Maysir) or misrepresent the nature of the transaction to the detriment of stakeholders (lack of transparency/fairness). The original exclusion of *all* R&D costs likely stems from accounting conservatism, as R&D outcomes can be uncertain, or the R&D is general and benefits future projects. However, in the context of a bespoke Istisna'a contract for developing a unique asset (like custom software or an AI platform), the development effort *is* the production process. Costs directly incurred in this specific development are economically the cost of creating that asset. Capitalizing direct production costs is a standard accounting practice for long-term contracts like Istisna'a (reflected in the \"Istisna'a work-in-progress account\" mentioned in para 2/1(b)). Allowing capitalization of R&D costs *directly attributable* to the contracted asset aligns the accounting cost with the economic substance of creating the asset. This does not introduce Riba, Gharar, or Maysir into the Istisna'a contract itself. It's a matter of cost allocation and recognition for financial reporting.\n    *   **Assessment:** Complies with core Shariah principles, as it relates to accounting treatment and aligns with the economic reality of creating a bespoke asset under Istisna'a.\n\n*   **2. Consistency Check (Internal & Other Standards):**\n    *   **Reasoning:**\n        *   **Internal Consistency (FAS 10):** The proposal refines, rather than contradicts, the concept of \"Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo'\" in para 2/1(a). It clarifies that for certain types of Al-Masnoo' (especially intangible ones created through development), the direct costs of production include the specific R&D required to meet the contract's specifications. It makes the cost accounting section more consistent with the broadened scope and subject matter definitions proposed in Proposals 1 and 2. Capitalizing costs of production is consistent with the use of a \"work-in-progress\" account (para 2/1(b)).\n        *   **Consistency with Other Standards:** Conventional accounting standards (like IAS 38) distinguish between research (often expensed) and development (potentially capitalized if criteria are met). While AAOIFI standards may not always mirror IFRS/FASB, aligning accounting treatment of bespoke development costs with the asset being created is a sound accounting principle. FAS 4 recognizes intangible assets can be contributed as capital, implying their value (and thus potentially their cost of creation) can be recognized. This proposal is specific to Istisna'a costs for the Sani' and seems justifiable within that specific context.\n    *   **Assessment:** Consistent with the purpose of Istisna'a cost accounting and aligns with the economic reality of bespoke development.\n\n*   **3. Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n    *   **Reasoning:** This is crucial for practical implementation, especially for Istisna'a contracts involving complex intangible assets like software or AI platforms. Developing such assets inherently involves activities conventionally labelled \"R&D.\" If all such costs are expensed regardless of whether they are directly tied to a specific, contracted-for asset, the cost of the Istisna'a project would be significantly understated, distorting the financial statements (e.g., understating assets and overstating expenses during the development phase, leading to misrepresentation of project profitability). Allowing capitalization of direct R&D provides a more accurate reflection of the economic investment in creating the contracted asset. It does require robust internal controls to track and allocate costs accurately, distinguishing direct from general R&D, but this is a standard accounting challenge.\n    *   **Assessment:** Highly practical and necessary for accurate financial reporting of Istisna'a contracts involving significant development effort.\n\n*   **4. Final Decision for Proposal 3:** APPROVED.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nAll three proposed enhancements address genuine ambiguities in the current FAS 10 when applied to contemporary transactions involving intangible assets and services, such as the AI software platform mentioned in the trigger scenario.\n\n*   Proposal 1 explicitly brings intangible assets and services into the scope and definition, which is consistent with an existing footnote and the broader recognition of intangible assets in other AAOIFI standards.\n*   Proposal 2 provides practical and Shariah-compliant guidance on how to specify these non-tangible subject matters, directly addressing the `Gharar` concern in a modern context.\n*   Proposal 3 allows for more accurate accounting of the costs of creating bespoke intangible assets under Istisna'a by permitting capitalization of direct R&D, aligning accounting with economic substance without violating core Shariah principles.\n\nTogether, these proposals significantly improve the clarity, relevance, and practical applicability of AAOIFI FAS 10 for a wider range of contemporary Islamic finance activities, particularly in the technology and service sectors. They do so while upholding the fundamental Shariah principles governing Istisna'a contracts.\n\n**Final Decision:** APPROVED.\n\n**Detailed Reasoning:** The proposed enhancements are well-reasoned and directly address the practical challenges faced by financial institutions applying FAS 10 to intangible assets and services. They are consistent with the underlying Shariah principles of Istisna'a (particularly the need to avoid Gharar through specification and the permissibility based on Maslaha), align with the existing recognition of services and, by extension, intangible assets within the standard's juristic basis and other AAOIFI standards, and provide necessary clarity for practical implementation and accurate financial reporting. The changes enhance the standard's ability to facilitate Shariah-compliant financing for modern economic activities."

        "cross_standard_analysis": "## Cross-Standard Impact Analysis\n\nThe proposed enhancement to FAS 10 primarily aims to modernize the standard by explicitly incorporating intangible assets and services within the scope of Istisna'a contracts and adapting the related requirements for specification and cost recognition. This addresses the growing use of Istisna'a for developing software, intellectual property, and complex services, which were not clearly covered by the original standard's focus on tangible manufacturing.\n\nThe proposed changes have the following potential impacts on other AAOIFI standards:\n\n1.  **Clarifying the nature of Istisna'a subject matter (Proposal 1):** By explicitly defining Al-Masnoo' to include tangible assets, intangible assets, services, or combinations, and broadening the description of Al-Sani's inputs, the proposal provides clearer boundaries for Istisna'a transactions. This helps differentiate Istisna'a from other contract types used for financing or providing assets/services. This clarification is generally beneficial for the overall clarity of the AAOIFI standards ecosystem.\n\n2.  **Providing detailed guidance for specifying intangible assets/services (Proposal 2):** Offering specific methods and examples for defining the kind, type, quality, and quantity of intangible assets and services under Istisna'a provides practical guidance. This is particularly relevant for contracts involving technology development or bespoke services. While other standards require subject matter or capital to be known and specified (like FAS 4, FAS 7, FAS 32), they often lack this level of detail for non-tangible items. The guidance in FAS 10 could serve as a useful reference or model for specifying intangible assets or services in other contract types if applicable.\n\n3.  **Allowing capitalization of direct R&D costs (Proposal 3):** This change recognizes that for certain Istisna'a contracts (especially those for developing unique intangible assets like software), R&D is not a general expense but a direct cost of creating the contracted asset. Capitalizing these directly attributable R&D costs will affect the cost basis of the resulting asset. This is a significant accounting treatment change specific to the creation/development nature of Istisna'a.\n\n**Impact on Specific Standards:**\n\n*   **FAS 4 (Musharakah and Mudarabah):** FAS 4 deals with partnership financing where partners contribute capital (which can be in the form of real or intangible assets) and share profits/losses. The proposed changes in FAS 10, particularly the explicit recognition and specification guidance for intangible assets (Proposals 1 & 2), align with the concept in FAS 4 that intangible assets can be contributed as Musharakah capital. While FAS 4 requires such assets to be known and specified and valued at fair value (Appendix D), the detailed methods for specifying intangibles in FAS 10 could offer helpful context if a Musharakah involves a complex intangible asset contribution. The R&D cost capitalization rule (Proposal 3) is specific to the creation process under Istisna'a and does not directly impact FAS 4's rules on recognizing and measuring Musharakah capital or profit/loss sharing. There are no apparent contradictions. There is a potential synergy in the consistent acknowledgement and potential methods for specifying intangible assets across standards.\n*   **FAS 7 (Salam and Parallel Salam):** FAS 7 deals with forward sales of fungible commodities or assets that can be specified by description and delivered later. The proposed changes explicitly defining Istisna'a's scope to include services and non-fungible intangible assets (Proposal 1) reinforces the fundamental distinction between Istisna'a (contract for manufacturing/developing a specific item/service) and Salam (forward sale of a fungible item). This distinction is a synergy, providing greater clarity on when each standard applies. The specification requirements in FAS 10 for intangibles/services (Proposal 2) are unlikely to be relevant to the typical subject matter of Salam. The R&D cost capitalization rule (Proposal 3) is not applicable to Salam, which involves the acquisition cost of the subject matter. There are no apparent contradictions.\n*   **FAS 28 (Murabaha and Other Deferred Payment Sales):** FAS 28 deals with the sale of an *identified* asset acquired by the seller (bank) before reselling it to the buyer. The proposed changes in FAS 10 emphasize the *creation* or *development* of the subject matter, which is fundamentally different from the acquisition-and-sale model of Murabaha. Explicitly defining Istisna'a's scope (Proposal 1) reinforces this distinction, which is a synergy. The specification requirements in FAS 10 (Proposal 2) are for the *development* process and are not relevant to Murabaha's requirement to identify the asset at the point of sale. The R&D cost capitalization rule (Proposal 3) is not applicable to Murabaha costs, which are the acquisition costs of the asset. There are no apparent contradictions.\n*   **FAS 32 (Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek):** FAS 32 deals with leasing tangible and intangible assets. An asset created or developed via an Istisna'a contract (especially an intangible asset) can subsequently be the subject of an Ijarah contract.\n    *   The explicit inclusion of intangible assets in the scope of Istisna'a (Proposal 1) clarifies that assets developed under Istisna'a can clearly fall under the scope of FAS 32 if leased, providing a synergy and clarifying the link between the two standards.\n    *   The detailed guidance on specifying intangible assets in FAS 10 (Proposal 2) could be highly relevant when describing and identifying a complex intangible asset for a lease contract under FAS 32. This offers a significant synergy in providing consistent approaches to describing non-tangible assets across related standards.\n    *   The capitalization of direct R&D costs under FAS 10 (Proposal 3) directly impacts the initial cost basis of the asset created. When this asset is subsequently leased under FAS 32, its cost basis is fundamental for accounting treatments such as depreciation/amortization and impairment testing. This creates a direct accounting link and requires consistency in how the value derived from the Istisna'a contract flows into the Ijarah accounting. This represents a medium impact due to the direct influence on asset measurement in FAS 32.\n    There are no apparent contradictions, but there is a need for careful consideration of how the cost basis established under FAS 10 translates into the asset's carrying amount under FAS 32.\n\n**Potential Contradictions/Inconsistencies:**\n\nBased on the analysis, there are no direct contradictions identified between the proposed enhancements to FAS 10 and the core principles or requirements of FAS 4, FAS 7, FAS 28, or FAS 32. The changes are primarily about clarifying and expanding the application of Istisna'a, which helps delineate its scope relative to other contracts.\n\n**Potential Synergies:**\n\n*   **Consistent treatment of intangible assets/services:** The explicit inclusion and detailed specification guidance for intangibles/services in FAS 10 can promote a more consistent understanding and approach to these asset types across other standards like FAS 4 (capital contributions) and FAS 32 (leased assets).\n*   **Clearer contract differentiation:** By clearly defining Istisna'a's scope (creation/development, including intangibles/services), the proposal helps financial institutions and auditors distinguish it from Murabaha (acquisition/sale) and potentially Salam (forward sale of fungibles), reducing ambiguity.\n*   **Improved specification practices:** The detailed guidance in FAS 10 (Proposal 2) could serve as a valuable resource or model for specifying complex intangible assets or services when they feature in other contract types like Musharakah or Ijarah.\n*   **Integrated asset accounting:** The direct impact of Istisna'a cost capitalization (Proposal 3) on the asset's cost basis for subsequent Ijarah accounting (FAS 32) highlights the interconnectedness of these standards when tracing the lifecycle of an asset from creation to use/lease.\n\n## Compatibility Matrix\n\n| Standard ID | Impact Level | Impact Type   |\n|-------------|--------------|---------------|\n| FAS 4       | Low          | Synergy       |\n| FAS 7       | Low          | Synergy       |\n| FAS 10      | High         | None          |\n| FAS 28      | Low          | Synergy       |\n| FAS 32      | Medium       | Both (Synergy & Direct Impact) |\n\n*Note: FAS 10 is listed as High/None because it is the standard being enhanced, so the impact is internal rather than external contradiction/synergy.*\n\n## Recommendations\n\nTo maintain consistency and leverage the synergies created by the proposed enhancements to FAS 10, the following recommendations are made:\n\n1.  **Cross-Reference Specification Guidance:** Consider adding cross-references in FAS 4 and FAS 32 (and potentially other relevant standards) to the detailed guidance on specifying intangible assets and services provided in the revised FAS 10. This would encourage a consistent approach to describing such complex subject matters across different contract types where specification is required (e.g., Musharakah capital, Ijarah leased assets).\n2.  **Ensure Consistency in Asset Valuation/Cost Basis Flow:** Explicitly clarify in FAS 32 how the cost basis of an asset created via Istisna'a, including capitalized R&D costs as determined under the revised FAS 10, should be used as the starting point for the asset's carrying amount and subsequent accounting (e.g., depreciation/amortization) when it becomes a leased asset under Ijarah. This ensures smooth transition and consistent measurement across the asset's lifecycle.\n3.  **Review Examples in Other Standards:** Review examples provided in FAS 4, FAS 7, FAS 28, and FAS 32 to ensure they remain consistent with the clarified scope of Istisna'a. For instance, ensure examples used to illustrate Murabaha or Salam do not inadvertently overlap with scenarios now clearly defined as Istisna'a, especially concerning services or development of unique assets.\n4.  **Harmonize Definitions (if necessary):** While the proposed changes align well, a general review of definitions related to \"asset,\" \"subject matter,\" \"tangible,\" and \"intangible\" across the five standards could be beneficial to ensure complete harmonization and avoid any subtle inconsistencies, although none were immediately apparent.\n5.  **Educational Outreach:** Provide guidance and training to practitioners on the revised scope of Istisna'a and its application to intangible assets and services, highlighting the distinctions and relationships with other contract types like Ijarah, Murabaha, and Musharakah.",

    "cross_standard_analysis": "## Cross-Standard Impact Analysis\n\nThe proposed enhancement to FAS 10 primarily aims to modernize the standard by explicitly incorporating intangible assets and services within the scope of Istisna'a contracts and adapting the related requirements for specification and cost recognition. This addresses the growing use of Istisna'a for developing software, intellectual property, and complex services, which were not clearly covered by the original standard's focus on tangible manufacturing.\n\nThe proposed changes have the following potential impacts on other AAOIFI standards:\n\n1.  **Clarifying the nature of Istisna'a subject matter (Proposal 1):** By explicitly defining Al-Masnoo' to include tangible assets, intangible assets, services, or combinations, and broadening the description of Al-Sani's inputs, the proposal provides clearer boundaries for Istisna'a transactions. This helps differentiate Istisna'a from other contract types used for financing or providing assets/services. This clarification is generally beneficial for the overall clarity of the AAOIFI standards ecosystem.\n\n2.  **Providing detailed guidance for specifying intangible assets/services (Proposal 2):** Offering specific methods and examples for defining the kind, type, quality, and quantity of intangible assets and services under Istisna'a provides practical guidance. This is particularly relevant for contracts involving technology development or bespoke services. While other standards require subject matter or capital to be known and specified (like FAS 4, FAS 7, FAS 32), they often lack this level of detail for non-tangible items. The guidance in FAS 10 could serve as a useful reference or model for specifying intangible assets or services in other contract types if applicable.\n\n3.  **Allowing capitalization of direct R&D costs (Proposal 3):** This change recognizes that for certain Istisna'a contracts (especially those for developing unique intangible assets like software), R&D is not a general expense but a direct cost of creating the contracted asset. Capitalizing these directly attributable R&D costs will affect the cost basis of the resulting asset. This is a significant accounting treatment change specific to the creation/development nature of Istisna'a.\n\n**Impact on Specific Standards:**\n\n*   **FAS 4 (Musharakah and Mudarabah):** FAS 4 deals with partnership financing where partners contribute capital (which can be in the form of real or intangible assets) and share profits/losses. The proposed changes in FAS 10, particularly the explicit recognition and specification guidance for intangible assets (Proposals 1 & 2), align with the concept in FAS 4 that intangible assets can be contributed as Musharakah capital. While FAS 4 requires such assets to be known and specified and valued at fair value (Appendix D), the detailed methods for specifying intangibles in FAS 10 could offer helpful context if a Musharakah involves a complex intangible asset contribution. The R&D cost capitalization rule (Proposal 3) is specific to the creation process under Istisna'a and does not directly impact FAS 4's rules on recognizing and measuring Musharakah capital or profit/loss sharing. There are no apparent contradictions. There is a potential synergy in the consistent acknowledgement and potential methods for specifying intangible assets across standards.\n*   **FAS 7 (Salam and Parallel Salam):** FAS 7 deals with forward sales of fungible commodities or assets that can be specified by description and delivered later. The proposed changes explicitly defining Istisna'a's scope to include services and non-fungible intangible assets (Proposal 1) reinforces the fundamental distinction between Istisna'a (contract for manufacturing/developing a specific item/service) and Salam (forward sale of a fungible item). This distinction is a synergy, providing greater clarity on when each standard applies. The specification requirements in FAS 10 for intangibles/services (Proposal 2) are unlikely to be relevant to the typical subject matter of Salam. The R&D cost capitalization rule (Proposal 3) is not applicable to Salam, which involves the acquisition cost of the subject matter. There are no apparent contradictions.\n*   **FAS 28 (Murabaha and Other Deferred Payment Sales):** FAS 28 deals with the sale of an *identified* asset acquired by the seller (bank) before reselling it to the buyer. The proposed changes in FAS 10 emphasize the *creation* or *development* of the subject matter, which is fundamentally different from the acquisition-and-sale model of Murabaha. Explicitly defining Istisna'a's scope (Proposal 1) reinforces this distinction, which is a synergy. The specification requirements in FAS 10 (Proposal 2) are for the *development* process and are not relevant to Murabaha's requirement to identify the asset at the point of sale. The R&D cost capitalization rule (Proposal 3) is not applicable to Murabaha costs, which are the acquisition costs of the asset. There are no apparent contradictions.\n*   **FAS 32 (Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek):** FAS 32 deals with leasing tangible and intangible assets. An asset created or developed via an Istisna'a contract (especially an intangible asset) can subsequently be the subject of an Ijarah contract.\n    *   The explicit inclusion of intangible assets in the scope of Istisna'a (Proposal 1) clarifies that assets developed under Istisna'a can clearly fall under the scope of FAS 32 if leased, providing a synergy and clarifying the link between the two standards.\n    *   The detailed guidance on specifying intangible assets in FAS 10 (Proposal 2) could be highly relevant when describing and identifying a complex intangible asset for a lease contract under FAS 32. This offers a significant synergy in providing consistent approaches to describing non-tangible assets across related standards.\n    *   The capitalization of direct R&D costs under FAS 10 (Proposal 3) directly impacts the initial cost basis of the asset created. When this asset is subsequently leased under FAS 32, its cost basis is fundamental for accounting treatments such as depreciation/amortization and impairment testing. This creates a direct accounting link and requires consistency in how the value derived from the Istisna'a contract flows into the Ijarah accounting. This represents a medium impact due to the direct influence on asset measurement in FAS 32.\n    There are no apparent contradictions, but there is a need for careful consideration of how the cost basis established under FAS 10 translates into the asset's carrying amount under FAS 32.\n\n**Potential Contradictions/Inconsistencies:**\n\nBased on the analysis, there are no direct contradictions identified between the proposed enhancements to FAS 10 and the core principles or requirements of FAS 4, FAS 7, FAS 28, or FAS 32. The changes are primarily about clarifying and expanding the application of Istisna'a, which helps delineate its scope relative to other contracts.\n\n**Potential Synergies:**\n\n*   **Consistent treatment of intangible assets/services:** The explicit inclusion and detailed specification guidance for intangibles/services in FAS 10 can promote a more consistent understanding and approach to these asset types across other standards like FAS 4 (capital contributions) and FAS 32 (leased assets).\n*   **Clearer contract differentiation:** By clearly defining Istisna'a's scope (creation/development, including intangibles/services), the proposal helps financial institutions and auditors distinguish it from Murabaha (acquisition/sale) and potentially Salam (forward sale of fungibles), reducing ambiguity.\n*   **Improved specification practices:** The detailed guidance in FAS 10 (Proposal 2) could serve as a valuable resource or model for specifying complex intangible assets or services when they feature in other contract types like Musharakah or Ijarah.\n*   **Integrated asset accounting:** The direct impact of Istisna'a cost capitalization (Proposal 3) on the asset's cost basis for subsequent Ijarah accounting (FAS 32) highlights the interconnectedness of these standards when tracing the lifecycle of an asset from creation to use/lease.\n\n## Compatibility Matrix\n\n| Standard ID | Impact Level | Impact Type   |\n|-------------|--------------|---------------|\n| FAS 4       | Low          | Synergy       |\n| FAS 7       | Low          | Synergy       |\n| FAS 10      | High         | None          |\n| FAS 28      | Low          | Synergy       |\n| FAS 32      | Medium       | Both (Synergy & Direct Impact) |\n\n*Note: FAS 10 is listed as High/None because it is the standard being enhanced, so the impact is internal rather than external contradiction/synergy.*\n\n## Recommendations\n\nTo maintain consistency and leverage the synergies created by the proposed enhancements to FAS 10, the following recommendations are made:\n\n1.  **Cross-Reference Specification Guidance:** Consider adding cross-references in FAS 4 and FAS 32 (and potentially other relevant standards) to the detailed guidance on specifying intangible assets and services provided in the revised FAS 10. This would encourage a consistent approach to describing such complex subject matters across different contract types where specification is required (e.g., Musharakah capital, Ijarah leased assets).\n2.  **Ensure Consistency in Asset Valuation/Cost Basis Flow:** Explicitly clarify in FAS 32 how the cost basis of an asset created via Istisna'a, including capitalized R&D costs as determined under the revised FAS 10, should be used as the starting point for the asset's carrying amount and subsequent accounting (e.g., depreciation/amortization) when it becomes a leased asset under Ijarah. This ensures smooth transition and consistent measurement across the asset's lifecycle.\n3.  **Review Examples in Other Standards:** Review examples provided in FAS 4, FAS 7, FAS 28, and FAS 32 to ensure they remain consistent with the clarified scope of Istisna'a. For instance, ensure examples used to illustrate Murabaha or Salam do not inadvertently overlap with scenarios now clearly defined as Istisna'a, especially concerning services or development of unique assets.\n4.  **Harmonize Definitions (if necessary):** While the proposed changes align well, a general review of definitions related to \"asset,\" \"subject matter,\" \"tangible,\" and \"intangible\" across the five standards could be beneficial to ensure complete harmonization and avoid any subtle inconsistencies, although none were immediately apparent.\n5.  **Educational Outreach:** Provide guidance and training to practitioners on the revised scope of Istisna'a and its application to intangible assets and services, highlighting the distinctions and relationships with other contract types like Ijarah, Murabaha, and Musharakah.",
