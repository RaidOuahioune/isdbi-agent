    "proposed_text": "Okay, based on the analysis provided regarding the challenges of applying AAOIFI FAS 10 (Istisna'a) to large-scale AI software development, here are proposed enhancements focusing on the \"Well-Defined Subject Matter\" and \"Determination of Cost/Fixed Price\" requirements, along with a related point on measuring progress for intangibles.\n\nSince I don't have the exact numbered clauses of FAS 10, I will structure the proposal by referring to the *principles* and *areas* within the standard that need enhancement, as identified in your analysis. The proposed text will be drafted as if it were being added to or modifying the relevant sections of the standard.\n\n---\n\n**Standards Enhancement Proposal: AAOIFI FAS 10 (Istisna'a)**\n\n**Objective:** To enhance AAOIFI FAS 10 to provide clearer guidance and flexibility for applying Istisna'a contracts to the development of intangible assets, such as complex software platforms, addressing challenges related to defining the subject matter and determining costs in iterative and uncertain environments.\n\n**Issue Addressed:** The current wording and underlying assumptions of FAS 10 are primarily geared towards tangible assets, creating ambiguity and practical difficulties when structuring Istisna'a for intangible, iteratively developed assets like large-scale AI software platforms. Specifically, the requirements for a 'well-defined subject matter' and a 'fixed price' are challenging to apply directly without causing undue risk or hindering the natural development process of such assets.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 1: Clarifying Application to Intangible Assets and Adapting \"Well-Defined Subject Matter\"**\n\n*   **Area:** Principles related to the Subject Matter of the Istisna'a contract.\n*   **Issue:** The standard implicitly focuses on tangible goods, making the application to intangibles unclear. The requirement for a strictly defined subject matter at contract inception is difficult for iterative software development.\n\n*   **Original Principle/Implicit Understanding:** The subject matter must be a specific, manufacturable/constructible item, clearly and completely defined at the time of contract. This definition often implies fixed specifications suitable for tangible goods.\n\n*   **Proposed Modified Text (Addition/Modification to relevant section on Subject Matter):**\n\n    \"The subject matter of the Istisna'a contract shall be an item that can be manufactured or constructed, and its specifications, quality, and quantity shall be clearly and completely defined at the time the contract is entered into.\n\n    **[New Paragraph/Sentence Addition]:** This requirement applies equally to intangible assets that are the result of a manufacturing or development process, such as software, digital content, or complex algorithms. For intangible assets, the definition of the subject matter shall focus on clearly specifying the required functionalities, key features, performance criteria, technical architecture principles, and acceptance testing procedures.\n\n    **[New Paragraph/Sentence Addition]:** Acknowledging the iterative nature of developing complex intangible assets, the initial contract shall define the core scope and requirements with sufficient clarity to establish the basis of the agreement and the fixed price. The contract may also include a pre-agreed, Sharia-compliant framework for managing and defining subsequent necessary refinements or agreed-upon changes to the detailed specifications or scope during the development process, provided such a framework ensures that any changes are mutually agreed upon, clearly documented, and impact the price and delivery schedule only as per the agreed mechanism within the contract.\"\n\n*   **Rationale:**\n    1.  **Explicit Inclusion of Intangibles:** Explicitly stating that intangible assets fall under Istisna'a removes ambiguity and validates the use of this contract type for modern development projects like software.\n    2.  **Adapting Definition for Intangibles:** Specifying that the definition for intangibles should focus on functionality, performance, etc., provides practical guidance relevant to software development.\n    3.  **Accommodating Iterative Development:** Introducing the concept of a pre-agreed change management framework addresses the reality of iterative development. This doesn't violate the \"well-defined\" principle but adapts its application, allowing the *initial* scope to be the basis while providing a structured, agreed method for handling necessary evolution *within* the contract, maintaining mutual consent and clarity on changes. This prevents arbitrary \"scope creep\" while allowing for practical project execution.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 2: Addressing Cost Uncertainty and Clarifying Fixed Price Application**\n\n*   **Area:** Principles related to the Price and Cost Determination in the Istisna'a contract.\n*   **Issue:** The requirement for a fixed price is challenging when initial cost estimation for complex intangible projects is highly uncertain. The standard's implicit assumption of reasonably predictable costs, typical for tangible manufacturing, doesn't fit well with variable labor and R&D components of software development.\n\n*   **Original Principle/Implicit Understanding:** The price must be fixed and determined at the time the contract is entered into. The manufacturer is expected to have a reliable basis for estimating costs to arrive at this fixed price.\n\n*   **Proposed Modified Text (Addition/Modification to relevant section on Price and Cost):**\n\n    \"The price of the Istisna'a contract shall be fixed and determined at the time the contract is entered into. This fixed price is binding on both parties for the subject matter as initially defined in the contract.\n\n    **[New Paragraph/Sentence Addition]:** While the determination of the manufacturer's internal cost for developing complex intangible assets, such as large-scale software, may involve inherent uncertainty due to factors like variable labor effort and unforeseen technical challenges, the contractually agreed fixed price provides certainty to the buyer for the initially defined scope.\n\n    **[New Paragraph/Sentence Addition]:** Any adjustments to the fixed price originally agreed upon shall only be permissible if they result directly from mutually agreed-upon and documented changes to the subject matter (scope, specifications, quality, quantity, or delivery timeline) as defined within the contract's pre-agreed change management framework (as mentioned in the Subject Matter section). Such adjustments must be determined and agreed upon by both parties at the time the change is approved, maintaining the principle of a fixed price for the *then-defined* scope.\"\n\n*   **Rationale:**\n    1.  **Acknowledging Uncertainty:** Explicitly acknowledging the inherent cost uncertainty in developing complex intangibles validates the practical challenges faced by developers and financial institutions.\n    2.  **Reinforcing Fixed Price for Defined Scope:** Clearly linking the fixed price to the *initially defined scope* maintains the core Istisna'a principle, providing the required certainty to the buyer for that scope.\n    3.  **Sharia-Compliant Price Adjustment Mechanism:** By allowing price adjustments *only* as a direct consequence of *mutually agreed changes* to the subject matter, and requiring these adjustments to be fixed *when the change is agreed*, the proposal maintains the fixed-price nature of the contract for *each defined phase or scope iteration*. This avoids open-ended cost-plus arrangements while providing necessary flexibility for project realities.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 3: Guidance on Measuring Progress for Intangible Assets (Relevant for Accounting)**\n\n*   **Area:** Principles related to determining the Stage of Completion (primarily relevant for revenue/cost recognition under percentage-of-completion method).\n*   **Issue:** The standard's guidance on measuring progress might implicitly favor methods suitable for tangible assets (e.g., cost incurred relative to total estimated cost, physical units completed), which may not be reliable or practical for intangible development.\n\n*   **Original Principle/Implicit Understanding:** The stage of completion is measured reliably to recognize revenue and costs. Methods may include cost incurred, work performed, or physical completion.\n\n*   **Proposed Modified Text (Addition/Modification to relevant section on Stage of Completion):**\n\n    \"The stage of completion of the Istisna'a contract shall be measured reliably to determine the proportion of revenue and costs to be recognized.\n\n    **[New Paragraph/Sentence Addition]:** For intangible assets, the stage of completion may be reliably measured using methods appropriate for the nature of the development process, such as achieving defined project milestones, completing specific functional modules, delivering tested components, or other objective measures of work performed, in addition to or instead of relying solely on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs. The chosen method shall be applied consistently and reflect the progress towards completing the defined subject matter.\"\n\n*   **Rationale:**\n    1.  **Providing Adaptable Methods:** Suggesting methods like milestones, functional completion, or testing phases offers practical, verifiable ways to measure progress for software and other intangibles, which are often delivered incrementally or based on achieving specific technical goals rather than accumulating physical costs.\n    2.  **Improving Reliability:** For software, relying solely on costs incurred can be unreliable (e.g., high initial costs for setup don't necessarily mean significant progress). Focusing on outputs or milestones provides a more accurate reflection of the stage of completion of the *subject matter*.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThese proposed enhancements aim to modernize AAOIFI FAS 10 by explicitly incorporating provisions for intangible assets and adapting the application of core Istisna'a principles \u2013 particularly regarding subject matter definition and fixed price \u2013 to the realities of complex, iterative development processes like large-scale AI software platforms. By providing clearer guidance and allowing for structured flexibility within a Sharia-compliant framework, these changes would make Istisna'a a more viable and practical financing tool for the digital economy.",
    "review": "Okay, let's analyze AAOIFI FAS 10 (Istisna'a) in the context of structuring an Istisna'a contract for a large-scale AI software platform, focusing on the challenges related to \"well-defined subject matter\" and \"determination of cost.\"\n\nWhile I don't have the full, specific text of FAS 10 clauses readily available to quote verbatim here (as AAOIFI standards are copyrighted and distributed), I can analyze the core principles typically found in Istisna'a standards regarding these requirements and how they interact with the unique nature of software development, particularly complex AI platforms.\n\nBased on the general principles of AAOIFI FAS 10 and the scenario provided, here are the potential gaps and areas needing enhancement:\n\n**1. Requirement: Well-Defined Subject Matter**\n\n*   **Relevant Standard Principle:** FAS 10, like other Istisna'a guidelines, requires the subject matter of the contract (the item to be manufactured or constructed) to be clearly and completely defined at the time the contract is entered into. This definition should cover specifications, quality, quantity, delivery timeline, etc., leaving no significant ambiguity about the final product.\n\n*   **Potential Gap/Ambiguity Identified:** The standard's language and underlying assumptions are primarily geared towards tangible goods or physical construction (e.g., a building, a ship, a piece of furniture). Defining a *large-scale AI software platform* with the required clarity and completeness *at the outset* is inherently difficult due to the nature of software development:\n    *   **Iterative Development:** Software development, especially for complex AI, often involves agile or iterative processes where specifications evolve as development progresses, user feedback is received, and technical challenges are encountered.\n    *   **Unforeseen Complexity:** The exact features, performance characteristics, and technical architecture may not be fully known or predictable at the start. Discoveries during development can necessitate significant changes.\n    *   **Intangibility:** Unlike a physical object with measurable dimensions and materials, software specifications relate to functionality, performance, security, scalability, and user experience, which are harder to define exhaustively and unambiguously upfront in a traditional Istisna'a manner.\n    *   **Scope Creep:** Software projects are highly susceptible to changes in requirements (scope creep), which directly impact the definition of the 'subject matter' post-contract signing.\n\n*   **Why this is an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:**\n    *   Applying a standard requiring a fixed, immutable definition of the subject matter to a dynamic, evolving AI software project creates a fundamental tension.\n    *   It makes it difficult for financial institutions and developers to comply strictly with the \"well-defined subject matter\" rule while using an Istisna'a contract structure.\n    *   It can lead to disputes between parties over whether the delivered product matches the initial (necessarily less-than-perfectly-defined) specification.\n    *   It challenges the application of accounting methods like the percentage-of-completion method, which often relies on a stable, defined scope to measure progress accurately.\n\n**2. Requirement: Determination of Cost (and Fixed Price)**\n\n*   **Relevant Standard Principle:** FAS 10 requires the price of the Istisna'a contract to be fixed and determined at the time of the contract. While cost determination is internal to the manufacturer/developer, the fixed price implies that the manufacturer has a reliable basis for estimating costs and pricing the project. The standard's accounting treatments (e.g., recognizing costs and revenues) assume a degree of predictability in project costs.\n\n*   **Potential Gap/Ambiguity Identified:** Determining the cost of developing a large-scale AI software platform with precision *at the outset* is extremely challenging, often far more so than estimating the cost of manufacturing physical goods or constructing a building.\n    *   **Labor-Intensive & Variable:** Software development costs are primarily labor costs, which can vary significantly based on the time required, the skill level needed for unforeseen technical hurdles, and the efficiency of the development process.\n    *   **R&D Component:** AI development often involves a significant research and development component, where the outcome and the effort required to achieve it are uncertain.\n    *   **Unforeseen Technical Challenges:** Encountering unexpected technical difficulties, performance bottlenecks, or integration issues can drastically increase development time and cost.\n    *   **Dependency on Evolving Specifications:** Since the subject matter definition may evolve (as discussed above), the cost required to deliver the final product is also subject to change.\n\n*   **Why this is an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:**\n    *   The requirement for a fixed price (which depends on reliable cost estimation) is difficult to meet in a way that is fair and sustainable for both the financial institution (buyer, potentially) and the software developer (manufacturer).\n    *   Developers face high risk if forced into a strictly fixed-price contract for a project with uncertain scope and cost.\n    *   Financial institutions face the risk of the project becoming unviable or the developer cutting corners if costs exceed the fixed price significantly.\n    *   Applying accounting principles based on predictable costs (like accumulating costs against a known total project cost for percentage of completion) becomes less reliable when the true final cost is highly uncertain.\n\n**Summary of Areas Needing Enhancement:**\n\nFAS 10, in its current form, appears to be primarily structured around tangible assets with relatively predictable specifications and costs. To better accommodate modern applications like AI software development under Istisna'a, the standard could benefit from enhancements that:\n\n1.  **Clarify the application to intangible assets:** Explicitly state how Istisna'a principles apply to the creation of intangible goods like software.\n2.  **Provide guidance on defining the subject matter for iterative projects:** Offer flexibility in defining the scope for projects where specifications evolve, perhaps allowing for phased definitions or incorporating mechanisms for handling agreed-upon changes within the Sharia framework.\n3.  **Address cost uncertainty in complex projects:** Provide guidance on how to structure pricing or account for costs in projects where initial cost estimation is inherently difficult and subject to significant variation. This might involve exploring mechanisms for handling cost overruns or incorporating risk-sharing elements while maintaining Sharia compliance.\n4.  **Offer methods for measuring progress for intangibles:** Suggest acceptable methods for measuring the stage of completion for software development, such as based on milestones achieved, functionality delivered, or rigorous testing phases, rather than solely relying on cost incurred or physical units.\n\nThese enhancements would make FAS 10 more adaptable to the realities of modern technology development, providing clearer guidance for financial institutions seeking to use Istisna'a for financing such projects.",

This avoids open-ended cost-plus arrangements while providing necessary flexibility for project realities.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Enhancement Proposal 3: Guidance on Measuring Progress for Intangible Assets (Relevant for Accounting)**\\n\\n*   **Area:** Principles related to determining the Stage of Completion (primarily relevant for revenue/cost recognition under percentage-of-completion method).\\n*   **Issue:** The standard\\'s guidance on measuring progress might implicitly favor methods suitable for tangible assets (e.g., cost incurred relative to total estimated cost, physical units completed), which may not be reliable or practical for intangible development.\\n\\n*   **Original Principle/Implicit Understanding:** The stage of completion is measured reliably to recognize revenue and costs. Methods may include cost incurred, work performed, or physical completion.\\n\\n*   **Proposed Modified Text (Addition/Modification to relevant section on Stage of Completion):**\\n\\n    \"The stage of completion of the Istisna\\'a contract shall be measured reliably to determine the proportion of revenue and costs to be recognized.\\n\\n    **[New Paragraph/Sentence Addition]:** For intangible assets, the stage of completion may be reliably measured using methods appropriate for the nature of the development process, such as achieving defined project milestones, completing specific functional modules, delivering tested components, or other objective measures of work performed, in addition to or instead of relying solely on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs. The chosen method shall be applied consistently and reflect the progress towards completing the defined subject matter.\"\\n\\n*   **Rationale:**\\n    1.  **Providing Adaptable Methods:** Suggesting methods like milestones, functional completion, or testing phases offers practical, verifiable ways to measure progress for software and other intangibles, which are often delivered incrementally or based on achieving specific technical goals rather than accumulating physical costs.\\n    2.  **Improving Reliability:** For software, relying solely on costs incurred can be unreliable (e.g., high initial costs for setup don\\'t necessarily mean significant progress). Focusing on outputs or milestones provides a more accurate reflection of the stage of completion of the *subject matter*.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nThese proposed enhancements aim to modernize AAOIFI FAS 10 by explicitly incorporating provisions for intangible assets and adapting the application of core Istisna\\'a principles \u2013 particularly regarding subject matter definition and fixed price \u2013 to the realities of complex, iterative development processes like large-scale AI software platforms.

Explicitly including intangible assets as valid subject matter and adapting the \"well-defined\" requirement to focus on functionalities, performance, etc., while allowing a pre-agreed framework for managing mutually agreed changes to detailed specifications.\\n2.  Acknowledging cost uncertainty for intangibles but reinforcing the fixed price for the *initially defined scope*, allowing price adjustments *only* for mutually agreed scope changes, with the adjustment fixed at the time of agreement.\\n3.  Suggesting adaptable methods for measuring progress for intangible assets (milestones, functional modules, etc.) for accounting purposes (percentage-of-completion).\\n\\n**Validation Checks:**\\n\\n**1. Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\\n\\n*   **Core Principles:**\\n    *   **Riba (Interest):** The proposal maintains the fixed price principle for the defined scope at each stage of agreement. Price adjustments are explicitly tied *only* to changes in the subject matter (scope, specifications, quality, quantity, or delivery timeline) and must be *mutually agreed upon* and *fixed* when the change is approved. This prevents the price from increasing due to deferred payment or other non-Shariah compliant factors. The proposal does not introduce any element of predetermined return on capital unrelated to the sale of the manufactured asset (the software). **Compliance: Compliant.**\\n    *   **Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty):**\\n        *   *Subject Matter:* The original standard requires the subject matter to be \"clearly and completely defined\" to remove \"any lack of knowledge\" (FAS 10, para 4/1/1). The proposal acknowledges this is difficult for complex intangibles upfront. It addresses this by requiring the *core scope and requirements* to be defined with \"sufficient clarity\" initially, and subsequent refinements must follow a \"pre-agreed, Sharia-compliant framework for managing and defining subsequent necessary refinements or agreed-upon changes\". This framework requires changes to be \"mutually agreed upon, clearly documented,\" and impact price/schedule only as per the agreed mechanism. This structured approach aims to manage and mitigate Gharar related to the evolving nature of the subject matter, rather than leaving it open-ended. By requiring mutual agreement and definition *at the time of change*, it ensures clarity for the *then-defined* subject matter, thus controlling excessive uncertainty.\\n        *   *Price:* The proposal reinforces the fixed price for the *initially defined scope* and requires price adjustments for changes to be *determined and agreed upon* at the time the change is approved. This directly addresses potential price Gharar associated with scope changes by ensuring the price for the modified scope is fixed and known when the modification is agreed upon. **Compliance: Compliant, provided the initial definition has sufficient clarity and the change management framework is robust and strictly adhered to, ensuring mutual agreement and definition at each stage.**\\n    *   **Maysir (Gambling):** The contract remains one of manufacturing/development and sale of a specific asset (the software). The price is fixed for the defined scope at each stage. There is no element of pure speculation or gambling introduced. **Compliance: Compliant.**\\n    *   **Asset-Backing:** Istisna\\'a is based on the manufacture/construction of a specific item. The proposal explicitly includes intangible assets like software. Software, as the output of a development process resulting in a functional platform, can be considered a valid subject matter for Istisna\\'a, representing an intangible asset. FAS 4 (Musharaka) Appendix D also mentions the valuation of intangible assets, indicating their recognition within AAOIFI\\'s framework. **Compliance: Compliant.**\\n    *   **Risk-Sharing:** Istisna\\'a is a sale contract, not a partnership. The manufacturer bears the risk of cost overruns relative to the fixed price for the defined scope. The proposal maintains this. If the manufacturer incurs higher costs than estimated for the *initially defined scope*, they bear that risk, consistent with Istisna\\'a. Price adjustments only occur for *agreed scope changes*, not simply cost overruns on the original scope. **Compliance: Compliant.**\\n\\n*   **FAS 10 Specific Principles:**\\n    *   **Specification of Subject Matter:** The proposal adapts this for intangibles (functionality, performance, etc.) and allows for a controlled, agreed process for refinements. This appears to be a valid adaptation rather than a violation, aiming to specify the intangible asset as precisely as possible given its nature.\\n    *   **Fixed Price:** The proposal explicitly maintains the fixed price principle by applying it to the defined scope at each stage of agreement.\\n\\n**Conclusion on Shariah Compliance:** The proposed enhancements appear to be Shariah compliant as they carefully navigate the challenges of applying Istisna\\'a to intangible, iterative projects by adapting the *application* of the principles (how to define subject matter, how to handle price changes) while maintaining the core requirements of clarity (managing Gharar through process) and price fixation for the defined scope at each stage of agreement.\\n\\n**2. Consistency Check:**\\n\\n*   **Internal Consistency (within FAS 10):**\\n    *   The proposal directly modifies or adds to the principles regarding Subject Matter and Price/Cost. It attempts to integrate the concepts of iterative development and change management into the existing framework. The proposed change management framework links the subject matter definition (Proposal 1) to the price adjustment mechanism (Proposal 2). This creates a consistent approach for handling dynamic requirements within the Istisna\\'a structure.\\n    *   The proposal for measuring progress (Proposal 3) aligns with the accounting treatment options already present in FAS 10 (e.g., percentage-of-completion, Appendix E), providing practical methods applicable to the specific nature of intangible assets. Appendix E mentions that a condition for percentage-of-completion is reasonable accuracy in estimating *cost*. Proposal 3 offers methods for measuring *work completed* (the numerator in the percentage calculation) which can be more reliable for intangibles, complementing the cost aspect.\\n    *   The proposed text for subject matter definition explicitly includes the original requirement for clarity (\"clearly and completely defined\") before adding the adaptation for intangibles, suggesting it\\'s intended as an extension, not a replacement.\\n    *   **Consistency: Consistent.** The proposal adapts the application of core principles for a new asset class without fundamentally contradicting the underlying structure of FAS 10.\\n\\n*   **External Consistency (with other related standards):**\\n    *   FAS 4 (Musharaka) Appendix D explicitly discusses intangible assets, supporting the broader recognition of intangables within AAOIFI standards. This aligns with Proposal 1\\'s explicit inclusion of intangible assets.\\n    *   FAS 7 (Salam) also requires the subject matter to be \"known by specification\" (Appendix D), similar to Istisna\\'a. While the contract types differ, the principle of specifying the asset is common, and adapting *how* specification is achieved for intangibles is consistent with this principle.\\n    *   **Consistency: Consistent.** The proposal aligns with the broader recognition of intangible assets and the need for asset specification found in other AAOIFI standards.\\n\\n**3. Practical Implementation Assessment:**\\n\\n*   **Proposal 1 (Subject Matter):** Defining functionality, performance criteria, etc., is standard practice in software development contracts. Implementing a pre-agreed change management framework is also standard practice (e.g., agile methodologies often have defined processes for backlog refinement, sprint planning, etc., though these need to be adapted to fit the Istisna\\'a contractual requirements for mutual agreement and documentation). This proposal makes the standard significantly more practical for technology projects. **Practicality: High.**\\n*   **Proposal 2 (Fixed Price/Cost):** Acknowledging cost uncertainty and providing a mechanism for price adjustment linked to scope changes reflects the reality of complex software development. A truly fixed price for an uncertain, iterative project is often commercially unviable for the developer or forces unrealistic risk assumptions. Allowing fixed price adjustments *at the time of agreed changes* is a practical way to manage this risk and maintain the fixed price principle for the *then-current* scope. **Practicality: High.**\\n*   **Proposal 3 (Measuring Progress):** Using milestones, functional completion, or testing phases are common project management techniques in software development. These provide tangible, verifiable points for measuring progress, which is more practical than relying solely on cost incurred for intangible outputs. **Practicality: High.**\\n\\n**Conclusion on Practical Implementation:** The proposed enhancements directly address the practical challenges identified in applying FAS 10 to complex intangible assets like AI software and align with common industry practices in technology development, making Istisna\\'a a viable financing tool for such projects.\\n\\n**4. Final Decision:**\\n\\n**APPROVED**\\n\\n**Detailed Reasoning:**\\n\\nThe proposed enhancement to AAOIFI FAS 10 effectively addresses the significant challenges in applying the standard to the development of complex intangible assets like large-scale AI software platforms.\\n\\n1.  **Shariah Compliance:** The proposal maintains the core Shariah principles of Istisna\\'a. It manages the issue of Gharar related to the subject matter and price in iterative projects by requiring initial definition of the core scope with sufficient clarity and implementing a structured, pre-agreed framework for managing subsequent *mutually agreed-upon* changes. Price adjustments are permissible only as a direct result of these agreed scope changes and must be fixed at the time the change is approved, upholding the fixed-price principle for the *then-defined* scope. No element of Riba or Maysir is introduced. The inclusion of intangible assets is consistent with Shariah\\'s recognition of various forms of wealth and assets.\\n2.  **Consistency:** The proposal is internally consistent with FAS 10 by adapting the application of its core principles (subject matter definition, fixed price) to a new asset class rather than contradicting them. It also aligns with the existing accounting guidance on revenue recognition (percentage-of-completion) by offering practical methods for measuring progress for intangibles. Externally, it is consistent with the recognition of intangible assets in other AAOIFI standards like FAS 4.\\n3.  **Practical Implementation:** The proposed changes provide much-needed clarity and flexibility for structuring Istisna\\'a contracts for modern technology development. Explicitly covering intangibles, adapting the subject matter definition to focus on functionality and performance, allowing for structured change management, and providing adaptable progress measurement methods directly address the practical difficulties faced by financial institutions and developers in this domain.\\n\\nThe proposed enhancements are well-reasoned, Shariah-compliant in principle, consistent with the standard\\'s objectives, and highly practical. The emphasis on mutual agreement and definition at each stage of change within a pre-agreed framework is key to ensuring Shariah compliance while accommodating the realities of iterative development.'}",

The proposed text will be drafted as if it were being added to or modifying the relevant sections of the standard.\n+ \n+ ---\n+ \n+ **Standards Enhancement Proposal: AAOIFI FAS 10 (Istisna'a)**\n+ \n+ **Objective:** To enhance AAOIFI FAS 10 to provide clearer guidance and flexibility for applying Istisna'a contracts to the development of intangible assets, such as complex software platforms, addressing challenges related to defining the subject matter and determining costs in iterative and uncertain environments.\n+ \n+ **Issue Addressed:** The current wording and underlying assumptions of FAS 10 are primarily geared towards tangible assets, creating ambiguity and practical difficulties when structuring Istisna'a for intangible, iteratively developed assets like large-scale AI software platforms. Specifically, the requirements for a 'well-defined subject matter' and a 'fixed price' are challenging to apply directly without causing undue risk or hindering the natural development process of such assets.\n+ \n+ ---\n+ \n+ **Enhancement Proposal 1: Clarifying Application to Intangible Assets and Adapting \"Well-Defined Subject Matter\"**\n+ \n+ *   **Area:** Principles related to the Subject Matter of the Istisna'a contract.\n+ *   **Issue:** The standard implicitly focuses on tangible goods, making the application to intangibles unclear. The requirement for a strictly defined subject matter at contract inception is difficult for iterative software development.\n+ \n+ *   **Original Principle/Implicit Understanding:** The subject matter must be a specific, manufacturable/constructible item, clearly and completely defined at the time of contract. This definition often implies fixed specifications suitable for tangible goods.\n+ \n+ *   **Proposed Modified Text (Addition/Modification to relevant section on Subject Matter):**\n+ \n+     \"The subject matter of the Istisna'a contract shall be an item that can be manufactured or constructed, and its specifications, quality, and quantity shall be clearly and completely defined at the time the contract is entered into.\n+ \n+     **[New Paragraph/Sentence Addition]:** This requirement applies equally to intangible assets that are the result of a manufacturing or development process, such as software, digital content, or complex algorithms. For intangible assets, the definition of the subject matter shall focus on clearly specifying the required functionalities, key features, performance criteria, technical architecture principles, and acceptance testing procedures.\n+ \n+     **[New Paragraph/Sentence Addition]:** Acknowledging the iterative nature of developing complex intangible assets, the initial contract shall define the core scope and requirements with sufficient clarity to establish the basis of the agreement and the fixed price. The contract may also include a pre-agreed, Sharia-compliant framework for managing and defining subsequent necessary refinements or agreed-upon changes to the detailed specifications or scope during the development process, provided such a framework ensures that any changes are mutually agreed upon, clearly documented, and impact the price and delivery schedule only as per the agreed mechanism within the contract.\"\n+ \n+ *   **Rationale:**\n+     1.  **Explicit Inclusion of Intangibles:** Explicitly stating that intangible assets fall under Istisna'a removes ambiguity and validates the use of this contract type for modern development projects like software.\n+     2.  **Adapting Definition for Intangibles:** Specifying that the definition for intangibles should focus on functionality, performance, etc., provides practical guidance relevant to software development.\n+     3.  **Accommodating Iterative Development:** Introducing the concept of a pre-agreed change management framework addresses the reality of iterative development. This doesn't violate the \"well-defined\" principle but adapts its application, allowing the *initial* scope to be the basis while providing a structured, agreed method for handling necessary evolution *within* the contract, maintaining mutual consent and clarity on changes. This prevents arbitrary \"scope creep\" while allowing for practical project execution.\n+ \n+ ---\n+ \n+ **Enhancement Proposal 2: Addressing Cost Uncertainty and Clarifying Fixed Price Application**\n+ \n+ *   **Area:** Principles related to the Price and Cost Determination in the Istisna'a contract.\n+ *   **Issue:** The requirement for a fixed price is challenging when initial cost estimation for complex intangible projects is highly uncertain. The standard's implicit assumption of reasonably predictable costs, typical for tangible manufacturing, doesn't fit well with variable labor and R&D components of software development.\n+ \n+ *   **Original Principle/Implicit Understanding:** The price must be fixed and determined at the time the contract is entered into. The manufacturer is expected to have a reliable basis for estimating costs to arrive at this fixed price.\n+ \n+ *   **Proposed Modified Text (Addition/Modification to relevant section on Price and Cost):**\n+ \n+     \"The price of the Istisna'a contract shall be fixed and determined at the time the contract is entered into. This fixed price is binding on both parties for the subject matter as initially defined in the contract.\n+ \n+     **[New Paragraph/Sentence Addition]:** While the determination of the manufacturer's internal cost for developing complex intangible assets, such as large-scale software, may involve inherent uncertainty due to factors like variable labor effort and unforeseen technical challenges, the contractually agreed fixed price provides certainty to the buyer for the initially defined scope.\n+ \n+     **[New Paragraph/Sentence Addition]:** Any adjustments to the fixed price originally agreed upon shall only be permissible if they result directly from mutually agreed-upon and documented changes to the subject matter (scope, specifications, quality, quantity, or delivery timeline) as defined within the contract's pre-agreed change management framework (as mentioned in the Subject Matter section). Such adjustments must be determined and agreed upon by both parties at the time the change is approved, maintaining the principle of a fixed price for the *then-defined* scope.\"\n+ \n+ *   **Rationale:**\n+     1.  **Acknowledging Uncertainty:** Explicitly acknowledging the inherent cost uncertainty in developing complex intangibles validates the practical challenges faced by developers and financial institutions.\n+     2.  **Reinforcing Fixed Price for Defined Scope:** Clearly linking the fixed price to the *initially defined scope* maintains the core Istisna'a principle, providing the required certainty to the buyer for that scope.\n+     3.  **Sharia-Compliant Price Adjustment Mechanism:** By allowing price adjustments *only* as a direct consequence of *mutually agreed changes* to the subject matter, and requiring these adjustments to be fixed *when the change is agreed*, the proposal maintains the fixed-price nature of the contract for *each defined phase or scope iteration*. This avoids open-ended cost-plus arrangements while providing necessary flexibility for project realities.\n+ \n+ ---\n+ \n+ **Enhancement Proposal 3: Guidance on Measuring Progress for Intangible Assets (Relevant for Accounting)**\n+ \n+ *   **Area:** Principles related to determining the Stage of Completion (primarily relevant for revenue/cost recognition under percentage-of-completion method).\n+ *   **Issue:** The standard's guidance on measuring progress might implicitly favor methods suitable for tangible assets (e.g., cost incurred relative to total estimated cost, physical units completed), which may not be reliable or practical for intangible development.\n+ \n+ *   **Original Principle/Implicit Understanding:** The stage of completion is measured reliably to recognize revenue and costs. Methods may include cost incurred, work performed, or physical completion.\n+ \n+ *   **Proposed Modified Text (Addition/Modification to relevant section on Stage of Completion):**\n+ \n+     \"The stage of completion of the Istisna'a contract shall be measured reliably to determine the proportion of revenue and costs to be recognized.\n+ \n+     **[New Paragraph/Sentence Addition]:** For intangible assets, the stage of completion may be reliably measured using methods appropriate for the nature of the development process, such as achieving defined project milestones, completing specific functional modules, delivering tested components, or other objective measures of work performed, in addition to or instead of relying solely on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs. The chosen method shall be applied consistently and reflect the progress towards completing the defined subject matter.\"\n+ \n+ *   **Rationale:**\n+     1.  **Providing Adaptable Methods:** Suggesting methods like milestones, functional completion, or testing phases offers practical, verifiable ways to measure progress for software and other intangibles, which are often delivered incrementally or based on achieving specific technical goals rather than accumulating physical costs.\n+     2.  **Improving Reliability:** For software, relying solely on costs incurred can be unreliable (e.g., high initial costs for setup don't necessarily mean significant progress). Focusing on outputs or milestones provides a more accurate reflection of the stage of completion of the *subject matter*.\n+ \n+ ---\n+ \n+ **Conclusion:**\n+ \n+ These proposed enhancements aim to modernize AAOIFI FAS 10 by explicitly incorporating provisions for intangible assets and adapting the application of core Istisna'a principles \u2013 particularly regarding subject matter definition and fixed price \u2013 to the realities of complex, iterative development processes like large-scale AI software platforms. By providing clearer guidance and allowing for structured flexibility within a Sharia-compliant framework, these changes would make Istisna'a a more viable and practical financing tool for the digital economy.",

      "word_diff_html": "<span class=\"deletion\">Dr. Abdul Sattar Abughoddah\n</span><span class=\"addition\">Okay, based on the analysis provided regarding the challenges of applying AAOIFI FAS </span>10<span class=\"deletion\">.</span><span class=\"addition\"> (Istisna&#x27;a) to large-scale AI software development, here are proposed enhancements focusing on the &quot;Well-Defined Subject Matter&quot; and &quot;Determination of Cost/Fixed Price&quot; requirements, along with a related point on measuring progress for intangibles.\n\nSince I don&#x27;t have the exact numbered clauses of FAS 10, I will structure the proposal by referring to the *principles* and *areas* within the standard that need enhancement, as identified in your analysis. The proposed text will be drafted as if it were being added to or modifying the relevant sections of the standard.\n\n---\n\n**Standards Enhancement Proposal: AAOIFI FAS 10 (Istisna&#x27;a)**\n\n**Objective:** To enhance AAOIFI FAS 10 to provide clearer guidance and flexibility for applying Istisna&#x27;a contracts to the development of intangible assets, such as complex software platforms, addressing challenges related to defining the subject matter and determining costs in iterative and uncertain environments.\n\n**Issue Addressed:** The current wording and underlying assumptions of FAS 10 are primarily geared towards tangible assets, creating ambiguity and practical difficulties when structuring Istisna&#x27;a for intangible, iteratively developed assets like large-scale AI software platforms. Specifically, the requirements for a &#x27;well-defined subject matter&#x27; and a &#x27;fixed price&#x27; are challenging to apply directly without causing undue risk or hindering the natural development process of such assets.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 1: Clarifying Application to Intangible Assets and Adapting &quot;Well-Defined Subject Matter&quot;**\n\n*   **Area:** Principles related to the Subject Matter of the Istisna&#x27;a contract.\n*   **Issue:** The standard implicitly focuses on tangible goods, making the application to intangibles unclear. The requirement for a strictly defined subject matter at contract inception is difficult for iterative software development.\n\n*   **Original Principle/Implicit Understanding:** The subject matter must be a specific, manufacturable/constructible item, clearly and completely defined at the time of contract. This definition often implies fixed specifications suitable for tangible goods.\n\n*   **Proposed Modified Text (Addition/Modification to relevant section on Subject Matter):**\n\n    &quot;The subject matter of the Istisna&#x27;a contract shall be an item that can be manufactured or constructed, and its specifications, quality, and quantity shall be clearly and completely defined at the time the contract is entered into.\n\n    **[New Paragraph/Sentence Addition]:** This requirement applies equally to intangible assets that are the result of a manufacturing or development process, such as software, digital content, or complex algorithms. For intangible assets, the definition of the subject matter shall focus on clearly specifying the required functionalities, key features, performance criteria, technical architecture principles, and acceptance testing procedures.\n\n    **[New Paragraph/Sentence Addition]:** Acknowledging the iterative nature of developing complex intangible assets, the initial contract shall define the core scope and requirements with sufficient clarity to establish the basis of the agreement and the fixed price. The contract may also include a pre-agreed, Sharia-compliant framework for managing and defining subsequent necessary refinements or agreed-upon changes to the detailed specifications or scope during the development process, provided such a framework ensures that any changes are mutually agreed upon, clearly documented, and impact the price and delivery schedule only as per the agreed mechanism within the contract.&quot;\n\n*   **Rationale:**\n    1.  **Explicit Inclusion of Intangibles:** Explicitly stating that intangible assets fall under Istisna&#x27;a removes ambiguity and validates the use of this contract type for modern development projects like software.\n    2.  **Adapting Definition for Intangibles:** Specifying that the definition for intangibles should focus on functionality, performance, etc., provides practical guidance relevant to software development.\n    3.  **Accommodating Iterative Development:** Introducing the concept of a pre-agreed change management framework addresses the reality of iterative development. This doesn&#x27;t violate the &quot;well-defined&quot; principle but adapts its application, allowing the *initial* scope to be the basis while providing a structured, agreed method for handling necessary evolution *within* the contract, maintaining mutual consent and clarity on changes. This prevents arbitrary &quot;scope creep&quot; while allowing for practical project execution.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 2: Addressing Cost Uncertainty and Clarifying Fixed Price Application**\n\n*   **Area:** Principles related to the Price and Cost Determination in the Istisna&#x27;a contract.\n*   **Issue:** The requirement for a fixed price is challenging when initial cost estimation for complex intangible projects is highly uncertain. The standard&#x27;s implicit assumption of reasonably predictable costs, typical for tangible manufacturing, doesn&#x27;t fit well with variable labor and R&amp;D components of software development.\n\n*   **Original Principle/Implicit Understanding:** The price must be fixed and determined at the time the contract is entered into. The manufacturer is expected to have a reliable basis for estimating costs to arrive at this fixed price.\n\n*   **Proposed Modified Text (Addition/Modification to relevant section on Price and Cost):**\n\n    &quot;The price of the Istisna&#x27;a contract shall be fixed and determined at the time the contract is entered into. This fixed price is binding on both parties for the subject matter as initially defined in the contract.\n\n    **[New Paragraph/Sentence Addition]:** While the determination of the manufacturer&#x27;s internal cost for developing complex intangible assets, such as large-scale software, may involve inherent uncertainty due to factors like variable labor effort and unforeseen technical challenges, the contractually agreed fixed price provides certainty to the buyer for the initially defined scope.\n\n    **[New Paragraph/Sentence Addition]:** Any adjustments to the fixed price originally agreed upon shall only be permissible if they result directly from mutually agreed-upon and documented changes to the subject matter (scope, specifications, quality, quantity, or delivery timeline) as defined within the contract&#x27;s pre-agreed change management framework (as mentioned in the Subject Matter section). Such adjustments must be determined and agreed upon by both parties at the time the change is approved, maintaining the principle of a fixed price for the *then-defined* scope.&quot;\n\n*   **Rationale:**\n    1.  **Acknowledging Uncertainty:** Explicitly acknowledging the inherent cost uncertainty in developing complex intangibles validates the practical challenges faced by developers and financial institutions.\n    2.  **Reinforcing Fixed Price for Defined Scope:** Clearly linking the fixed price to the *initially defined scope* maintains the core Istisna&#x27;a principle, providing the required certainty to the buyer for that scope.\n    3.  **Sharia-Compliant Price Adjustment Mechanism:** By allowing price adjustments *only* as a direct consequence of *mutually agreed changes* to the subject matter, and requiring these adjustments to be fixed *when the change is agreed*, the proposal maintains the fixed-price nature of the contract for *each defined phase or scope iteration*. This avoids open-ended cost-plus arrangements while providing necessary flexibility for project realities.\n\n---\n\n**Enhancement Proposal 3: Guidance on Measuring Progress for Intangible Assets (Relevant for Accounting)**\n\n*   **Area:** Principles related to determining the Stage of Completion (primarily relevant for revenue/cost recognition under percentage-of-completion method).\n*   **Issue:** The standard&#x27;s guidance on measuring progress might implicitly favor methods suitable for tangible assets (e.g., cost incurred relative to total estimated cost, physical units completed), which may not be reliable or practical for intangible development.\n\n*   **Original Principle/Implicit Understanding:** The stage of completion is measured reliably to recognize revenue and costs. Methods may include cost incurred, work performed, or physical completion.\n\n*   **Proposed Modified Text (Addition/Modification to relevant section on Stage of Completion):**\n\n    &quot;The stage of completion of the Istisna&#x27;a contract shall be measured reliably to determine the proportion of revenue and costs to be recognized.\n\n    **[New Paragraph/Sentence Addition]:** For intangible assets, the stage of completion may be reliably measured using methods appropriate for the nature of the development process, such as achieving defined project milestones, completing specific functional modules, delivering tested components, or other objective measures of work performed, in addition to or instead of relying solely on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs. The chosen method shall be applied consistently and reflect the progress towards completing the defined subject matter.&quot;\n\n*   **Rationale:**\n    1.  **Providing Adaptable Methods:** Suggesting methods like milestones, functional completion, or testing phases offers practical, verifiable ways to measure progress for software and other intangibles, which are often delivered incrementally or based on achieving specific technical goals rather than accumulating physical costs.\n    2.  **Improving Reliability:** For software, relying solely on costs incurred can be unreliable (e.g., high initial costs for setup don&#x27;t necessarily mean significant progress). Focusing on outputs or milestones provides a more accurate reflection of the stage of completion of the *subject matter*.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThese proposed enhancements aim to modernize AAOIFI FAS 10 by explicitly incorporating provisions for intangible assets and adapting the application of core Istisna&#x27;a principles \u2013 particularly regarding subject matter definition and fixed price \u2013 to the realities of complex, iterative development processes like large-scale AI software platforms. By providing clearer guidance and allowing for structured flexibility within a Sharia-compliant framework, these changes would make Istisna&#x27;a a more viable and practical financing tool for the digital economy.</span>",
