    "review": "Okay, as the Standards Reviewer Agent, I will analyze AAOIFI FAS 10 based on the provided text and the trigger scenario involving an Istisna'a contract for a large-scale AI software platform.\n\nThe core issue highlighted by the trigger scenario is the application of FAS 10, which appears primarily oriented towards tangible manufacturing and construction, to an intangible asset like software development, specifically concerning the definition of the subject matter and cost determination.\n\nHere are the detailed findings on sections that may need enhancement:\n\n1.  **Specific Section/Clause:** Appendix C, Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a, Paragraph 4/1 - Al-Masnoo\u2019 (Subject Matter)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The standard lists requirements for Al-Masnoo' to be known and specified: \"a) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.; b) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.; c) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications; and d) Quantity.\"\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** This framework is clearly designed for physical, tangible assets. Applying \"Kind\", \"Type\", \"Quality\" (based on \"established tables of specifications\"), and especially \"Quantity\" to a complex, evolving AI software platform is highly ambiguous.\n        *   *Kind/Type:* What is the \"kind\" or \"type\" of an AI platform? Is it \"AI software\", \"Machine Learning Platform\", \"Natural Language Processing System\"? These terms are broad and may not provide the necessary specificity required by the standard.\n        *   *Quality:* How is the \"quality\" of AI software specified using \"established tables of specifications\"? Software quality is often defined by performance metrics (accuracy, speed), reliability, scalability, user experience, security, and adherence to functional/non-functional requirements, which are dynamic and project-specific, not typically found in \"established tables\".\n        *   *Quantity:* What constitutes the \"quantity\" of an AI software platform? Lines of code? Number of features? Number of users it can support? These metrics don't fully capture the essence or value of the subject matter in the same way that the quantity of cars or houses does.\n    *   **Potential Enhancement Area:** The standard needs to explicitly address the nature of intangible assets like software. It should provide alternative or supplementary criteria for defining and specifying Al-Masnoo' when it is intangible, focusing on functional requirements, performance metrics, technical architecture, security standards, and development milestones rather than categories suited for physical goods.\n\n2.  **Specific Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, Paragraph 2/1(a) - Istisna\u2019a costs\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The standard explicitly states that \"research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs.\"\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** The development of a large-scale AI software platform inherently involves significant research and development activities. This exclusion means that a core component of the cost of creating the subject matter (Al-Masnoo') cannot be capitalized as Istisna'a costs under this standard. This contradicts the fundamental nature of the contract, which is to finance the *creation* of the asset. It would require the financial institution (as Al-Sani' or financing Al-Sani') to expense potentially large R&D costs immediately, distorting the true cost of the Istisna'a asset being developed.\n    *   **Potential Enhancement Area:** This exclusion needs to be reconsidered or clarified specifically for intangible assets like software where R&D is integral to the production process. The standard should differentiate between general R&D and R&D directly tied to the development of the specific Al-Masnoo' under contract, allowing the latter to be included in Istisna'a costs.\n\n3.  **Specific Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, Paragraph 2/3/1/1 and Appendix E (Basis for Conclusions) - Percentage-of-Completion Method\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The standard prefers the percentage-of-completion method for revenue/profit recognition \"provided that the contract costs can be estimated with reasonable accuracy.\" The completed contract method is used only in \"unusual circumstances where... the expected cost to complete the contract cannot be estimated with reasonable accuracy\".\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** Developing large-scale, novel AI software platforms is characterized by inherent uncertainties regarding scope evolution, technical challenges, and resource requirements. Estimating the total cost and the percentage of completion with \"reasonable accuracy\" is often significantly more challenging than in traditional construction or manufacturing projects. This could mean that many such contracts would default to the less preferred completed-contract method, delaying profit recognition and potentially misrepresenting the economic substance of the ongoing project for financial reporting purposes. The standard doesn't provide specific guidance on *how* to measure \"work completed\" or estimate costs reliably for intangible, complex, and potentially iterative development projects like AI software.\n    *   **Potential Enhancement Area:** The standard should acknowledge the specific challenges in estimating costs and measuring progress for intangible assets like software. It could provide alternative methods or specific guidelines for determining \"reasonable accuracy\" and measuring \"work completed\" in such contexts, potentially allowing for more flexible approaches or different types of milestones (e.g., functional milestones, performance benchmarks) to determine the percentage of completion.\n\n4.  **Specific Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, Paragraph 2/1(a) and Definitions (Appendix F) - Direct vs. Indirect Costs\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** Direct costs are defined as \"in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo\u2019\". Indirect costs are \"relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis.\" General and administrative, selling, and R&D costs are excluded. The definitions of \"Istisna\u2019a Work-in-Progress Account\" and \"Istisna\u2019a Costs Account\" focus on accumulating \"Istisna\u2019a contract costs\" and \"progress billings\".\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** The *nature* of costs in AI software development differs significantly from traditional manufacturing. Costs include developer salaries, cloud computing resources (for training/running AI models), software licenses, data acquisition/cleaning, specialized hardware (GPUs), and testing infrastructure. It's unclear how these map precisely to \"costs of producing Al-Masnoo'\" in a physical sense. Are developer salaries direct labor? Are cloud resources direct material/overhead? The standard's cost categorization and accumulation methods seem tailored to physical production inputs and processes.\n    *   **Potential Enhancement Area:** The standard should provide clarification or specific guidance on the types of costs incurred in intangible asset development (specifically software/AI) that qualify as direct or allocable indirect Istisna'a costs. It needs to address how costs like personnel time, computing resources, and third-party software/data are treated.\n\n5.  **Specific Section/Clause:** Appendix C, Juristic Rules, Paragraph 6 - Transfer of Ownership\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** States that \"the transfer of title of ownership is automatic and unconditional and Al-Sani\u2019 is entitled to the agreed upon amount once the contract is constituted\" (based on some views/legislations) or upon delivery (based on other views).\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** For software, especially large platforms, \"delivery\" and \"transfer of ownership\" can be complex. It might involve phased rollouts, deployment on specific infrastructure (cloud/on-premise), granting licenses, transferring intellectual property rights, and acceptance testing periods that differ from taking possession of a physical item. The standard's concept of transfer seems more aligned with physical possession. This could create ambiguity regarding the timing of the transfer and Al-Sani's entitlement to payment, potentially impacting revenue recognition timing, especially if the contract has specific acceptance clauses tied to performance metrics (like AI accuracy).\n    *   **Potential Enhancement Area:** The standard could benefit from clarifying how the concept of \"transfer of ownership\" and \"delivery\" applies to intangible assets, considering common practices in software development contracts, including acceptance testing phases and the transfer of intellectual property rights or licenses.\n\nIn summary, while FAS 10 provides a foundational framework for Istisna'a contracts, its language, examples, and underlying assumptions appear heavily influenced by traditional manufacturing and construction. Applying it directly to the development of complex, intangible assets like AI software platforms exposes significant ambiguities and gaps, particularly concerning the definition and specification of the subject matter, the determination and capitalization of costs (especially R&D), and the measurement of progress for revenue recognition. Enhancements are needed to provide clear guidance for such contemporary applications of the Istisna'a structure.",
    "proposal": "```\n# Proposal 1: Clarification of Subject Matter Definition for Intangible Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe current definition and criteria for Al-Masnoo' (subject matter) in Appendix C, specifically regarding kind, type, quality (via established tables), and quantity, are tailored for physical, tangible assets and do not adequately address the unique nature of intangible assets like software, leading to ambiguity in applying the standard to such contracts.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nAppendix (C)\nJuristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n4.

Conditions for the Validity of Istisna\u2019a\n4/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019\n4/1/1 Al-Masnoo\u2019 must be known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge of its. For tangible assets, this typically includes specifying:\na) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.;\nb) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.;\nc) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications; and\nd) Quantity.\nFor intangible assets, such as software, the specification should be sufficient to define the subject matter clearly and may include, but is not limited to:\ne) Functional and non-functional requirements;\nf) Technical specifications and architecture;\ng) Performance metrics and benchmarks; and\nh) Scope of features or modules.\n\n## Rationale\nThe original text's criteria for specifying Al-Masnoo' (kind, type, quality via established tables, quantity) are suitable for physical goods but are difficult or impossible to apply meaningfully to intangible assets like software. This enhancement clarifies that while these criteria apply to tangible assets, alternative or supplementary methods of specification are required for intangibles, providing examples relevant to software development (functional requirements, technical specs, performance metrics, scope). This addresses the ambiguity and allows the standard to be practically applied to a wider range of contemporary Istisna'a contracts involving intangible deliverables, consistent with the Shari'a principle of removing *Gharar* (uncertainty) from the subject matter.\n\n```\n# Proposal 2: Clarification on Inclusion of Project-Specific R&D Costs\n\n## Issue Identified\nParagraph 2/1(a) explicitly excludes research and development costs from Istisna'a contract costs. In the context of developing intangible assets like software, significant R&D is often integral to the production process of the specific asset being created under the contract, and its exclusion distorts the true cost of the Istisna'a asset.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nStatement of the Standard\n2.

General and administrative expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs. (para. 2)\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\nStatement of the Standard\n2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)\n2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs\na) Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis. General and administrative expenses and selling expenses shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs. Research and development costs that are directly attributable to the specific Al-Masnoo\u2019 under the Istisna\u2019a contract and necessary for its production may be included in Istisna\u2019a contract costs. General or non-contract-specific research and development costs shall not be included. (para. 2)\n\n## Rationale\nThe original exclusion of all R&D costs is problematic for Istisna'a contracts involving the creation of assets where R&D is a core component of the production process, such as complex software or novel machinery. This enhancement differentiates between general, non-contract-specific R&D (which should be expensed) and R&D that is specifically required for and directly attributable to the creation of the contracted Al-Masnoo'. Allowing the latter to be included in Istisna'a costs provides a more accurate representation of the cost of the asset being developed under the contract, aligning the accounting treatment with the economic substance of the transaction, particularly relevant for intangible assets.\n\n```\n# Proposal 3: Guidance on Measuring Progress for Intangible Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe standard's preference for the percentage-of-completion method relies on the ability to estimate contract costs and measure work completed with \"reasonable accuracy.\" This is inherently more challenging for intangible assets like complex software due to evolving requirements, technical uncertainties, and iterative development processes compared to traditional construction or manufacturing. This can force the use of the less preferred completed-contract method, potentially delaying profit recognition and misrepresenting the project's status.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nStatement of the Standard\n2.

The percentage of completion method is preferred because it provides for a better matching of Istisna\u2019a revenues and expenses. Furthermore, it reflects in a more accurate manner the outcome of the earning activities of Al-Sani\u2019 (the Islamic bank) over the entire time period of contract execution, thereby presenting more relevant information to users of the financial statements.\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\nStatement of the Standard\n2.

A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy. For contracts involving intangible assets such as software, the determination of the percentage of completion may utilize methods appropriate to the nature of the asset being developed, such as achievement of defined milestones, functional completion, or performance benchmarks, provided these measures are objectively verifiable.\n[...]\nThe first alternative; i.e., percentage of completion method, was chosen for the recognition of Istisna\u2019a and parallel Istisna\u2019a profit, provided that the contract costs can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. However, if the contract costs cannot be estimated with reasonable accuracy, the completed contract method should be used. The percentage of completion method is preferred because it provides for a better matching of Istisna\u2019a revenues and expenses. Furthermore, it reflects in a more accurate manner the outcome of the earning activities of Al-Sani\u2019 (the Islamic bank) over the entire time period of contract execution, thereby presenting more relevant information to users of the financial statements.\n\n## Rationale\nThe original text assumes a relatively straightforward estimation of costs and measurement of physical progress (e.g., based on costs incurred or physical units completed), which is typical in construction or manufacturing. For complex intangible assets like software, progress is often better tracked through functional milestones, performance testing, or specific deliverables rather than purely cost incurred or physical units. This enhancement adds flexibility to the percentage-of-completion method by suggesting alternative, verifiable measures of progress applicable to intangible assets, acknowledging the challenges in cost estimation for such projects and providing clearer guidance on how \"reasonable accuracy\" might be achieved in this context. This supports the preferred method for profit recognition and provides more relevant information to financial statement users.\n\n```\n# Proposal 4: Clarification of Software Development Costs in Cost Categorization\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe standard's categorization of Istisna'a costs into direct and indirect costs, while excluding certain types of expenses, seems primarily designed for physical production. It lacks clarity on how costs typically incurred in intangible asset development, such as personnel costs (developer salaries), computing resources (cloud usage), software licenses, and data acquisition/processing, should be classified as direct or allocable indirect costs.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nStatement of the Standard\n2. Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank As Al-Sani\u2019 (A Seller)\n2/1 Istisna\u2019a costs\na) Istisna\u2019a costs consist of: (I) Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo\u2019; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis.

(para. 2)\n\nAppendix (F)\nDefinitions\nIstisna\u2019a Work-in-Progress Account\nThis is an asset account in which the Istisna\u2019a contract costs are accumulated. When the percentage-of-completion method is used, a portion of Istisna\u2019a profit commensurate with the work completed during a financial period is also debited to this account.\nIstisna\u2019a Costs Account\nThis is an asset account used when a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists. It accumulates progress billings made by the subcontractor. A portion of the Istisna\u2019a profit commensurate with the work completed during a financial period is also debited to this account.\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\nStatement of the Standard\n2.

General and administrative expenses and selling expenses shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs. Research and development costs that are directly attributable to the specific Al-Masnoo\u2019 under the Istisna\u2019a contract and necessary for its production may be included in Istisna\u2019a contract costs. General or non-contract-specific research and development costs shall not be included. For intangible assets like software, direct costs may include personnel costs (e.g., salaries of developers, engineers) directly engaged in the production of Al-Masnoo\u2019, costs of computing resources specifically utilized for the project (e.g., cloud services for development, testing, training), and costs of project-specific third-party software licenses or data acquisition. (para. 2)\n\nAppendix (F)\nDefinitions\nIstisna\u2019a Work-in-Progress Account\nThis is an asset account in which the Istisna\u2019a contract costs are accumulated. Istisna'a contract costs include direct and allocable indirect costs incurred in producing Al-Masnoo'. For intangible assets, specific guidance on relevant costs is provided in paragraph 2/1(a). When the percentage-of-completion method is used, a portion of Istisna\u2019a profit commensurate with the work completed during a financial period is also debited to this account.\nIstisna\u2019a Costs Account\nThis is an asset account used when a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists. It accumulates progress billings made by the subcontractor. The costs accumulated reflect the Istisna'a contract costs incurred by the Islamic bank in its role as Al-Mustasni' in the parallel contract. A portion of the Istisna\u2019a profit commensurate with the work completed during a financial period is also debited to this account.\n\n## Rationale\nThe original standard's cost examples and definitions are heavily weighted towards physical manufacturing or construction. This creates ambiguity when applying the standard to software development, where the nature of costs is different. This enhancement provides specific examples of typical software development costs (personnel, computing, licenses, data) and clarifies how they should be considered direct or allocable indirect costs within the existing cost categorization framework. This provides necessary guidance for financial institutions applying FAS 10 to intangible asset development contracts, ensuring consistent and appropriate cost capitalization.\n\n```\n# Proposal 5: Clarification of Transfer of Ownership and Delivery for Intangible Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nAppendix C, Paragraph 6 discusses the transfer of ownership and entitlement to payment, seemingly based on the concept of physical delivery or the contract being constituted. For intangible assets like software, \"delivery\" and \"transfer of ownership\" can be complex, involving phased deployments, licensing, intellectual property transfer, and acceptance testing, which differs from taking physical possession. This creates ambiguity regarding the timing of revenue recognition and asset transfer for software Istisna'a.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nAppendix (C)\nJuristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n6. Transfer of Ownership\n[...]\nThis is the view adopted by recent civil Islamic legislations, and modern transactions, whereby both the transfer of title of ownership is automatic and unconditional and Al-Sani\u2019 is entitled to the agreed upon amount once the contract is constituted.\n[...]\nOther jurists are of the view that Al-Sani\u2019 is entitled to the agreed upon amount once Al-Masnoo\u2019 is delivered to Al-Mustasni\u2019.\n[...]\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\nAppendix (C)\nJuristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n6. Transfer of Ownership\n[...]\nThis is the view adopted by recent civil Islamic legislations, and modern transactions, whereby both the transfer of title of ownership is automatic and unconditional and Al-Sani\u2019 is entitled to the agreed upon amount once the contract is constituted.\n[...]\nOther jurists are of the view that Al-Sani\u2019 is entitled to the agreed upon amount once Al-Masnoo\u2019 is delivered to Al-Mustasni\u2019.\nFor intangible assets like software, 'delivery' and 'transfer of ownership' should be interpreted based on the contractual terms which may include granting specific licenses, transferring intellectual property rights, successful completion of acceptance testing, or deployment on the Mustasni's systems, as these represent the practical equivalent of transfer of control or benefit.\n\n## Rationale\nThe concept of transfer of ownership and delivery is straightforward for physical goods but requires clarification for intangible assets like software. Software delivery often involves granting usage rights (licenses), transferring associated intellectual property, and undergoing acceptance testing to ensure it meets specifications, rather than a simple handover of a physical item. This enhancement provides guidance on how \"delivery\" and \"transfer of ownership\" should be understood in the context of intangible assets, linking it to contractual milestones that signify the point at which Al-Mustasni' obtains effective control or benefit from the completed Al-Masnoo'. This clarifies the timing for potential revenue recognition and asset transfer in line with the specific nature of software contracts.\n```",
    "validation": "# Validation Results\n\n## Primary Validation Assessment\nOkay, Standards Validator Agent commencing evaluation of the proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 concerning intangible assets, specifically software development.\n\n**Evaluation Framework:**\n\n1.  **Shariah Compliance:** Does the proposal adhere to core Islamic finance principles (no Riba, Gharar, Maysir) and specific FAS 10 Shariah requirements (specified subject matter, fixed price, etc.)?\n2.  **Consistency:** Is the proposal consistent with the existing text of FAS 10 and other relevant AAOIFI standards?\n3.  **Practical Implementation:** Is the proposed change practical and implementable by financial institutions?\n4.  **Reasoning:** Is the justification for the proposed change clear and sound?\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 1: Clarification of Subject Matter Definition for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Add supplementary criteria (functional/non-functional requirements, technical specs, performance metrics, scope) for defining the subject matter (Al-Masnoo') for intangible assets like software, alongside the existing criteria for tangible assets.\n*   **Relevant Text:** Appendix (C), 4/1/1.\n*   **Rationale:** The original criteria (kind, type, quality, quantity) are insufficient for intangibles, leading to Gharar. The proposal provides relevant, practical ways to specify intangible assets.\n\n*   **Validation Checks:**\n    *   **Shariah Compliance:** The core Shariah principle relevant here is the prohibition of **Gharar** (excessive uncertainty). A fundamental requirement for a valid Istisna'a contract is that the subject matter (Al-Masnoo') must be known and specified sufficiently to remove any significant lack of knowledge (\u062c\u0647\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0641\u0627\u062d\u0634\u0629). The original text's criteria are designed for tangible goods. Applying these rigidly to intangible assets like software would indeed fail to adequately define the subject matter, introducing significant uncertainty about what is being contracted for. The proposed supplementary criteria (functional requirements, technical specifications, performance metrics, scope) are precisely the methods used in modern contracts for intangible development (especially software) to define the subject matter and remove ambiguity. Therefore, this proposal directly supports and enhances compliance with the Shariah principle of mitigating Gharar in the context of contemporary assets. It does not introduce Riba, Maysir, or conflict with other core principles.\n    *   **Consistency:** The proposed text does not replace the original criteria but adds guidance for a specific asset class (intangibles) where the original criteria are less applicable. It maintains the *principle* of requiring the subject matter to be known and specified, adapting the *method* of specification to the nature of the asset. This is consistent with the standard's overall objective of providing accounting guidance for Istisna'a while adhering to Shariah rules. There is no conflict with other standards mentioned (FAS 4, FAS 7) as they deal with different contract types or different aspects of asset valuation (FAS 4 mentions valuing *existing* intangible assets in Musharaka capital, whereas FAS 10 deals with *creating* an intangible asset).\n    *   **Practical Implementation:** Defining software by functional/non-functional requirements, technical architecture, performance benchmarks, and scope is standard practice in the software development industry. This is highly practical and reflects the real-world methods used to contract for such assets.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The rationale correctly identifies the gap in the current standard for intangible assets and proposes a practical, Shariah-compliant solution by providing relevant specification criteria that effectively remove Gharar for software Istisna'a.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED.**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal directly addresses a critical ambiguity in applying FAS 10 to intangible assets, which are increasingly relevant in modern finance. It enhances compliance with the Shariah principle of removing Gharar by providing practical and relevant methods for specifying the subject matter (Al-Masnoo') for software. It is consistent with the standard's intent and structure and is highly implementable based on industry practice.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 2: Clarification on Inclusion of Project-Specific R&D Costs**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Modify the exclusion of R&D costs in Statement of Standard, 2/1(a), to allow inclusion of R&D costs directly attributable to the specific Al-Masnoo' under the contract and necessary for its production, while still excluding general or non-contract-specific R&D.\n*   **Relevant Text:** Statement of the Standard, 2/1(a).\n*   **Rationale:** Excluding all R&D distorts the true cost for contracts where R&D is integral to the production of the specific asset, especially for complex or novel assets like advanced software. Allowing project-specific R&D provides a more accurate cost representation.\n\n*   **Validation Checks:**\n    *   **Shariah Compliance:** Shariah does not prescribe specific accounting cost classifications. The validity of the Istisna'a contract itself is based on principles like fixed price, specified subject matter, etc., which are not affected by this proposal. The proposal concerns the *accounting treatment* of costs incurred in executing a valid Istisna'a contract. Capitalizing costs directly related to creating the specific asset (the Masnoo') is a standard accounting practice aimed at accurately reflecting the cost of the asset being produced. Excluding R&D that is *essential* and *specific* to creating the contracted asset could lead to understating the asset's cost and distorting the matching of costs and revenues (relevant to the percentage-of-completion method preferred in FAS 10, Appendix E). This refinement enhances the accuracy and transparency of financial reporting, which aligns with the broader Shariah principles of fairness and clarity in dealings. It does not introduce Riba, Gharar, or Maysir.\n    *   **Consistency:** The proposal modifies 2/1(a) by refining the exclusion of R&D. This distinction between general R&D (expensed) and project-specific development costs (potentially capitalized as part of the asset cost) is a common principle in accounting for intangible asset development (e.g., under IFRS). Applying this distinction to Istisna'a costs makes the standard more robust when applied to complex, innovative projects. It appears consistent with the overall accounting framework of FAS 10, which aims to capitalize costs incurred in producing the Masnoo'.\n    *   **Practical Implementation:** Distinguishing between general R&D and project-specific R&D/development costs requires clear project definitions and cost tracking, which is standard practice in managing development projects, including software. It is implementable, although it requires careful internal cost allocation systems.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The rationale correctly identifies that R&D is often an integral part of producing complex, custom assets and that a blanket exclusion distorts the true cost. The proposal provides a reasonable distinction that aligns accounting treatment with the economic reality of such contracts.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED.**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal improves the accuracy of Istisna'a cost measurement for contracts involving significant project-specific development work, particularly relevant for intangible assets. This refinement aligns accounting treatment with the economic substance of the transaction and supports better financial reporting without violating any Shariah principles. It is practical and consistent with accounting principles applied to development costs.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 3: Guidance on Measuring Progress for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Add guidance to Statement of Standard, 2/3/1/1 and Appendix E, suggesting alternative verifiable measures of progress for intangible assets (milestones, functional completion, performance benchmarks) in addition to or instead of traditional cost-based inputs, to support the application of the percentage-of-completion method.\n*   **Relevant Text:** Statement of the Standard, 2/3/1/1; Appendix (E), Basis for Conclusions.\n*   **Rationale:** Traditional methods of measuring progress are difficult for intangibles like software, hindering the use of the preferred percentage-of-completion method. Alternative measures provide practical ways to achieve \"reasonable accuracy\" and enable more relevant profit recognition.\n\n*   **Validation Checks:**\n    *   **Shariah Compliance:** The choice of accounting method for profit recognition (percentage-of-completion vs. completed contract) is primarily an accounting issue, not a direct Shariah principle, as long as it reflects actual work completed and does not involve recognizing profit on transactions that have not yet matured or where significant Gharar remains regarding completion. Istisna'a profit is fixed at the outset. The percentage-of-completion method allocates this fixed profit over the contract period based on progress. The proposal aims to provide valid ways to measure *progress* for intangible assets. Using objectively verifiable milestones, functional completion, or performance benchmarks are legitimate ways to assess how much of the contracted work has been completed for software. This supports the accurate allocation of the fixed profit commensurate with the work done, which is consistent with the intent of the percentage-of-completion method as described in Appendix E (\"proportion to the work completed\"). It does not introduce Riba (profit is fixed, not interest), Gharar (it aims to make the progress measurement *less* uncertain), or Maysir.\n    *   **Consistency:** The proposal supports the application of the percentage-of-completion method, which FAS 10 identifies as the *preferred* method (Appendix E). It provides necessary clarification on how the condition of \"reasonable accuracy\" in measuring completion can be met for intangible assets, where cost-based methods alone might be misleading or impractical. This enhances the applicability and robustness of the standard's preferred accounting method. It is consistent with the standard's framework.\n    *   **Practical Implementation:** Measuring project progress by milestones, functional deliverables, or performance metrics is a standard, widely used practice in software development projects. This is highly practical and often more meaningful than purely cost-based measures for intangible deliverables.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The rationale correctly identifies the difficulty of applying traditional progress measurement to intangibles and the consequence of being forced into the less informative completed-contract method. The proposed alternative measures are standard in the relevant industry and provide a practical path to applying the preferred accounting method accurately.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED.**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal provides essential practical guidance for applying the preferred percentage-of-completion accounting method to Istisna'a contracts for intangible assets. By suggesting alternative, verifiable measures of progress, it improves the accuracy and relevance of financial reporting for such contracts, fully consistent with Shariah principles and the intent of the standard. It is highly implementable.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 4: Clarification of Software Development Costs in Cost Categorization**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Add specific examples of typical software development costs (personnel, computing resources, software licenses, data acquisition) to the definition of direct and allocable indirect costs in Statement of Standard, 2/1(a) and Appendix F.\n*   **Relevant Text:** Statement of the Standard, 2/1(a); Appendix (F), Definitions.\n*   **Rationale:** The original standard lacks clarity on how costs specific to intangible development should be classified, creating ambiguity. The proposal provides examples to guide classification. (Note: This proposal incorporates the R&D clarification from Proposal 2, but the core distinct element here is the list of cost examples).\n\n*   **Validation Checks:**\n    *   **Shariah Compliance:** Similar to Proposal 2, this concerns accounting cost classification and does not affect the Shariah validity of the Istisna'a contract itself. Providing clear examples of costs helps ensure accurate and consistent measurement of the cost of production (of the Masnoo'). This supports the principles of transparency and accurate financial reporting, which are compatible with Shariah. It does not involve Riba, Gharar, or Maysir.\n    *   **Consistency:** The proposal adds specific examples of costs relevant to intangible assets within the existing framework of direct and indirect costs. This is consistent with the structure of the standard (2/1(a) defines costs) and the definitions provided in Appendix F. It doesn't alter the fundamental cost principles but provides necessary detail for a specific context (intangible assets).\n    *   **Practical Implementation:** Identifying and classifying costs like personnel time, computing resource usage, and specific licenses or data purchases as direct or allocable indirect project costs is standard practice in project accounting for software development. This is practical and implementable, requiring appropriate internal systems.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The rationale correctly identifies the need for specific guidance on cost classification for intangible assets. The examples provided are relevant and common in software development and fit logically within the standard's existing cost categories.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED.**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal provides valuable and necessary practical guidance by offering concrete examples of how common software development costs should be classified within the existing Istisna'a cost framework. This enhances clarity, consistency, and accuracy in accounting for intangible asset development contracts, without conflicting with Shariah principles or other parts of the standard. It is highly implementable.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 5: Clarification of Transfer of Ownership and Delivery for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Add clarification to Appendix C, 6, explaining that 'delivery' and 'transfer of ownership' for intangible assets like software should be interpreted based on contractual terms (licensing, IP transfer, acceptance testing, deployment) that represent the transfer of control or benefit.\n*   **Relevant Text:** Appendix (C), 6.\n*   **Rationale:** The concept of delivery is physical in the original text but needs interpretation for intangibles like software, where transfer involves licensing, IP, and testing. Clarification is needed for timing of revenue recognition and asset transfer.\n\n*   **Validation Checks:**\n    *   **Shariah Compliance:** In Istisna'a, the Sani' becomes entitled to the price (or installments) upon completion and delivery of the Masnoo', or as otherwise contractually agreed upon. The key point from a Shariah perspective is that the customer (Mustasni') receives the agreed-upon asset, and the Sani' fulfills their obligation to produce and deliver it according to specifications. For intangible assets, the practical fulfillment of this obligation and the transfer of effective control or benefit occurs through mechanisms like granting licenses, transferring necessary IP rights, and ensuring the asset meets specifications via acceptance testing and deployment. These contractual events serve the same purpose as physical delivery for tangible goods \u2013 they signify the point at which the Mustasni' has received what was contracted for and the Sani' has completed performance. Clarifying that 'delivery' for intangibles refers to these contractual triggers aligns the standard with the economic reality of the transaction and ensures that the timing of entitlement and revenue recognition is linked to the actual fulfillment of the Sani's obligation and transfer of benefit to the Mustasni'. This addresses potential Gharar related to the completion and handover point for non-physical assets. It does not introduce Riba, Maysir, or conflict with other core principles.\n    *   **Consistency:** The proposal adds an interpretation of existing terms ('delivery', 'transfer of ownership') for a specific asset type (intangibles) within Appendix C, 6. It does not alter the fundamental principles of Istisna'a but clarifies their application. This clarification is crucial for the consistent application of revenue recognition principles (e.g., percentage-of-completion or completed contract methods, which ultimately rely on the concept of completion and transfer) to intangible assets.\n    *   **Practical Implementation:** Contracts for software development routinely define \"delivery\" and \"acceptance\" in terms of milestones, testing phases, deployment events, and transfer of rights (licenses, IP). The proposed interpretation is entirely practical and reflects standard industry practice.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The rationale correctly identifies the ambiguity of applying the physical concept of delivery to intangible assets and the need for clarification regarding the point at which the Sani's obligation is fulfilled and the Mustasni' gains control/benefit. The proposed interpretation, linking delivery to contractual events signifying transfer of control or benefit, is sound and practical.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED.**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal provides essential clarification on the concept of 'delivery' and 'transfer of ownership' for intangible assets within FAS 10, which is crucial for accurate application of the standard's revenue recognition and asset transfer principles. It aligns the standard with the practical realities of contracting for intangible assets in a manner fully consistent with Shariah principles. It is highly implementable.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nAll five proposed enhancements are well-reasoned, directly address practical issues in applying FAS 10 to intangible assets like software, enhance clarity and accuracy in accounting for such contracts, maintain consistency with the standard's framework, and are fully compatible with Shariah principles by reducing Gharar and supporting transparency. They are based on practical, implementable methods common in relevant industries.\n\nTherefore, all five proposals are Recommended for Approval.\n\n## Additional Shariah Compliance Insights\nThe following insights were provided by specialized Islamic Finance Compliance resources with access to Quran and Sunnah references:\n\nAll five proposals appear to be compliant with Shariah principles, specifically regarding Istisna'a contracts, and aim to reduce *Gharar* (uncertainty) and ensure fairness in transactions involving intangible assets like software. Here's a breakdown:\n\n**General Principles Underpinning the Analysis:**\n\n*   **Permissibility of Contracts ( \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0635\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0628\u0627\u062d\u0629 ):**  The general rule in Islamic jurisprudence is that contracts are permissible unless explicitly prohibited by the Quran or Sunnah. These proposals don't introduce anything explicitly prohibited.\n*   **Removal of *Gharar* ( \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0631 ):**  A core principle in Islamic finance is the avoidance of excessive uncertainty or ambiguity (*Gharar*) in contracts.  The Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibited transactions involving *Gharar*.  These proposals directly address *Gharar* by clarifying definitions and processes for intangible assets.\n*   **Fairness and Justice ( \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0625\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0646 ):**  Islamic finance emphasizes fairness and justice in all dealings.  These proposals aim to ensure that accounting practices accurately reflect the economic reality of software development, preventing unfair outcomes for either party in the Istisna'a contract.\n*   **Substance over Form ( \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0627\u0635\u062f ):**  Islamic jurisprudence emphasizes the intent and substance of a transaction over its mere form.  The proposals focus on aligning accounting treatment with the underlying economic substance of software Istisna'a contracts.\n*   **Custom and Usage ( \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u062d\u0643\u0645\u0629 ):**  Customary practices (*Urf*) are considered a source of law in Islamic jurisprudence, provided they do not contradict explicit Islamic texts or principles.  The proposals acknowledge the unique characteristics of the software industry and adapt existing rules to fit those customs.\n\n**Proposal-by-Proposal Analysis:**\n\n**Proposal 1: Clarification of Subject Matter Definition for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Shariah Compliance:** Compliant.  The proposal directly addresses *Gharar* by providing clearer guidelines for defining *Al-Masnoo'* (the subject matter) in software Istisna'a contracts.  The original definition, geared towards tangible assets, creates ambiguity for intangibles.  Specifying functional requirements, technical specifications, performance metrics, and scope reduces this ambiguity.\n*   **Quran/Sunnah Reference:**  While there's no specific verse or Hadith detailing how to define software, the general prohibition of *Gharar* (uncertainty) in transactions is well-established.  The Quran emphasizes clarity and honesty in dealings: *\"O you who believe! When you deal with each other, in transactions valid for a stated term, reduce it to writing...\"* (Quran 2:282). This verse, while about debt, highlights the importance of clear documentation to avoid disputes, a principle applicable to defining the subject matter of a contract.\n*   **Justification:**  By ensuring a clear understanding of what is being produced, the proposal prevents disputes and ensures that both parties are aware of their obligations.\n\n**Proposal 2: Clarification on Inclusion of Project-Specific R&D Costs**\n\n*   **Shariah Compliance:** Compliant.  The proposal distinguishes between general R&D (which remains excluded) and R&D directly attributable to the specific *Al-Masnoo'*.  Including the latter provides a more accurate reflection of the cost of production, aligning with the principle of fairness.\n*   **Quran/Sunnah Reference:**  The principle of fairness and avoiding unjust enrichment is central to Islamic finance.  The Quran states: *\"And do not consume one another's wealth unjustly...\"* (Quran 2:188).  Excluding project-specific R&D could lead to an inaccurate representation of costs, potentially benefiting one party unfairly.\n*   **Justification:**  This proposal ensures that the cost of the *Al-Masnoo'* accurately reflects the resources used in its creation, promoting fairness and transparency.\n\n**Proposal 3: Guidance on Measuring Progress for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Shariah Compliance:** Compliant.  The proposal addresses the difficulty of applying traditional percentage-of-completion methods to software development.  Suggesting alternative, verifiable measures of progress (milestones, functional completion, performance benchmarks) allows for more accurate profit recognition and avoids delaying recognition unnecessarily.\n*   **Quran/Sunnah Reference:**  The emphasis on accurate measurement and avoiding deception is relevant here.  The Quran warns against giving short measure: *\"Woe to those who give less [than due], Those who, when they take a measure from people, take in full, But when they give a measure or weight to them, cause loss.\"* (Quran 83:1-3).  While about physical measures, the principle extends to accurately measuring progress in a contract.\n*   **Justification:**  By allowing for more appropriate measures of progress, the proposal ensures that profit recognition is aligned with the actual work completed, preventing misrepresentation of the project's status.\n\n**Proposal 4: Clarification of Software Development Costs in Cost Categorization**\n\n*   **Shariah Compliance:** Compliant.  The proposal provides specific examples of software development costs (personnel, computing, licenses, data) and clarifies their classification as direct or allocable indirect costs.  This reduces ambiguity and ensures consistent cost capitalization.\n*   **Quran/Sunnah Reference:**  The general principle of transparency and clear accounting is relevant.  The Quran encourages detailed record-keeping in financial transactions (Quran 2:282).  This proposal contributes to clearer accounting by providing specific guidance on cost categorization.\n*   **Justification:**  This proposal promotes transparency and consistency in accounting for software development costs, ensuring that financial statements accurately reflect the economic reality of the Istisna'a contract.\n\n**Proposal 5: Clarification of Transfer of Ownership and Delivery for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Shariah Compliance:** Compliant.  The proposal clarifies that \"delivery\" and \"transfer of ownership\" for software should be interpreted based on contractual terms, such as granting licenses, transferring IP, or successful acceptance testing.  This aligns the accounting treatment with the point at which the *Mustasni'* (buyer) obtains effective control or benefit.\n*   **Quran/Sunnah Reference:**  The principle of fulfilling contractual obligations is paramount in Islam.  The Quran states: *\"O you who believe! Fulfill [all] contracts.\"* (Quran 5:1).  This proposal ensures that the transfer of ownership is recognized when the contractual obligations related to the software are substantially fulfilled.\n*   **Justification:**  This proposal ensures that revenue recognition and asset transfer are aligned with the point at which the *Mustasni'* gains control and benefit from the software, fulfilling the contractual obligations and promoting fairness.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll five proposals are consistent with Shariah principles. They address the unique characteristics of intangible assets like software within the framework of Istisna'a contracts, reducing *Gharar*, promoting fairness, and ensuring that accounting practices accurately reflect the economic substance of the transactions. They do not contradict any explicit Quranic verses or Hadiths and are aligned with the broader principles of Islamic finance.\n\nReferences:\n- FAS Document Chunks: 152672_Al-Masri-Book.pdf (Page 37), 152672_Al-Masri-Book.pdf (Page 7), 152672_Al-Masri-Book.pdf (Page 351), 152672_Al-Masri-Book.pdf (Page 347), 152672_Al-Masri-Book.pdf (Page 29), 152672_Al-Masri-Book.pdf (Page 349), 152672_Al-Masri-Book.pdf (Page 5), 152672_Al-Masri-Book.pdf (Page 348)\n\n\n## Final Decision\nAfter reviewing both the primary assessment and specialized Islamic Finance Compliance insights, the final decision is: APPROVED",

        "review_analysis": "Okay, as the Standards Reviewer Agent, I will analyze AAOIFI FAS 10 based on the provided text and the trigger scenario involving an Istisna'a contract for a large-scale AI software platform.\n\nThe core issue highlighted by the trigger scenario is the application of FAS 10, which appears primarily oriented towards tangible manufacturing and construction, to an intangible asset like software development, specifically concerning the definition of the subject matter and cost determination.\n\nHere are the detailed findings on sections that may need enhancement:\n\n1.  **Specific Section/Clause:** Appendix C, Juristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a, Paragraph 4/1 - Al-Masnoo\u2019 (Subject Matter)\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The standard lists requirements for Al-Masnoo' to be known and specified: \"a) Kind, e.g., car, airoplane or house, etc.; b) Type, e.g., a Toyota car, a Boeing airoplane, a house for low income individuals, etc.; c) Quality, e.g., as specified according to established tables of specifications; and d) Quantity.\"\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** This framework is clearly designed for physical, tangible assets. Applying \"Kind\", \"Type\", \"Quality\" (based on \"established tables of specifications\"), and especially \"Quantity\" to a complex, evolving AI software platform is highly ambiguous.\n        *   *Kind/Type:* What is the \"kind\" or \"type\" of an AI platform? Is it \"AI software\", \"Machine Learning Platform\", \"Natural Language Processing System\"? These terms are broad and may not provide the necessary specificity required by the standard.\n        *   *Quality:* How is the \"quality\" of AI software specified using \"established tables of specifications\"? Software quality is often defined by performance metrics (accuracy, speed), reliability, scalability, user experience, security, and adherence to functional/non-functional requirements, which are dynamic and project-specific, not typically found in \"established tables\".\n        *   *Quantity:* What constitutes the \"quantity\" of an AI software platform? Lines of code? Number of features? Number of users it can support? These metrics don't fully capture the essence or value of the subject matter in the same way that the quantity of cars or houses does.\n    *   **Potential Enhancement Area:** The standard needs to explicitly address the nature of intangible assets like software. It should provide alternative or supplementary criteria for defining and specifying Al-Masnoo' when it is intangible, focusing on functional requirements, performance metrics, technical architecture, security standards, and development milestones rather than categories suited for physical goods.\n\n2.  **Specific Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, Paragraph 2/1(a) - Istisna\u2019a costs\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The standard explicitly states that \"research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna\u2019a contract costs.\"\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** The development of a large-scale AI software platform inherently involves significant research and development activities. This exclusion means that a core component of the cost of creating the subject matter (Al-Masnoo') cannot be capitalized as Istisna'a costs under this standard. This contradicts the fundamental nature of the contract, which is to finance the *creation* of the asset. It would require the financial institution (as Al-Sani' or financing Al-Sani') to expense potentially large R&D costs immediately, distorting the true cost of the Istisna'a asset being developed.\n    *   **Potential Enhancement Area:** This exclusion needs to be reconsidered or clarified specifically for intangible assets like software where R&D is integral to the production process. The standard should differentiate between general R&D and R&D directly tied to the development of the specific Al-Masnoo' under contract, allowing the latter to be included in Istisna'a costs.\n\n3.  **Specific Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, Paragraph 2/3/1/1 and Appendix E (Basis for Conclusions) - Percentage-of-Completion Method\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The standard prefers the percentage-of-completion method for revenue/profit recognition \"provided that the contract costs can be estimated with reasonable accuracy.\" The completed contract method is used only in \"unusual circumstances where... the expected cost to complete the contract cannot be estimated with reasonable accuracy\".\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** Developing large-scale, novel AI software platforms is characterized by inherent uncertainties regarding scope evolution, technical challenges, and resource requirements. Estimating the total cost and the percentage of completion with \"reasonable accuracy\" is often significantly more challenging than in traditional construction or manufacturing projects. This could mean that many such contracts would default to the less preferred completed-contract method, delaying profit recognition and potentially misrepresenting the economic substance of the ongoing project for financial reporting purposes. The standard doesn't provide specific guidance on *how* to measure \"work completed\" or estimate costs reliably for intangible, complex, and potentially iterative development projects like AI software.\n    *   **Potential Enhancement Area:** The standard should acknowledge the specific challenges in estimating costs and measuring progress for intangible assets like software. It could provide alternative methods or specific guidelines for determining \"reasonable accuracy\" and measuring \"work completed\" in such contexts, potentially allowing for more flexible approaches or different types of milestones (e.g., functional milestones, performance benchmarks) to determine the percentage of completion.\n\n4.  **Specific Section/Clause:** Statement of the Standard, Paragraph 2/1(a) and Definitions (Appendix F) - Direct vs. Indirect Costs\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** Direct costs are defined as \"in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo\u2019\". Indirect costs are \"relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis.\" General and administrative, selling, and R&D costs are excluded. The definitions of \"Istisna\u2019a Work-in-Progress Account\" and \"Istisna\u2019a Costs Account\" focus on accumulating \"Istisna\u2019a contract costs\" and \"progress billings\".\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** The *nature* of costs in AI software development differs significantly from traditional manufacturing. Costs include developer salaries, cloud computing resources (for training/running AI models), software licenses, data acquisition/cleaning, specialized hardware (GPUs), and testing infrastructure. It's unclear how these map precisely to \"costs of producing Al-Masnoo'\" in a physical sense. Are developer salaries direct labor? Are cloud resources direct material/overhead? The standard's cost categorization and accumulation methods seem tailored to physical production inputs and processes.\n    *   **Potential Enhancement Area:** The standard should provide clarification or specific guidance on the types of costs incurred in intangible asset development (specifically software/AI) that qualify as direct or allocable indirect Istisna'a costs. It needs to address how costs like personnel time, computing resources, and third-party software/data are treated.\n\n5.  **Specific Section/Clause:** Appendix C, Juristic Rules, Paragraph 6 - Transfer of Ownership\n    *   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** States that \"the transfer of title of ownership is automatic and unconditional and Al-Sani\u2019 is entitled to the agreed upon amount once the contract is constituted\" (based on some views/legislations) or upon delivery (based on other views).\n    *   **Why this might be an issue in the context of the trigger scenario:** For software, especially large platforms, \"delivery\" and \"transfer of ownership\" can be complex. It might involve phased rollouts, deployment on specific infrastructure (cloud/on-premise), granting licenses, transferring intellectual property rights, and acceptance testing periods that differ from taking possession of a physical item. The standard's concept of transfer seems more aligned with physical possession. This could create ambiguity regarding the timing of the transfer and Al-Sani's entitlement to payment, potentially impacting revenue recognition timing, especially if the contract has specific acceptance clauses tied to performance metrics (like AI accuracy).\n    *   **Potential Enhancement Area:** The standard could benefit from clarifying how the concept of \"transfer of ownership\" and \"delivery\" applies to intangible assets, considering common practices in software development contracts, including acceptance testing phases and the transfer of intellectual property rights or licenses.\n\nIn summary, while FAS 10 provides a foundational framework for Istisna'a contracts, its language, examples, and underlying assumptions appear heavily influenced by traditional manufacturing and construction. Applying it directly to the development of complex, intangible assets like AI software platforms exposes significant ambiguities and gaps, particularly concerning the definition and specification of the subject matter, the determination and capitalization of costs (especially R&D), and the measurement of progress for revenue recognition. Enhancements are needed to provide clear guidance for such contemporary applications of the Istisna'a structure."

This enhancement clarifies that while these criteria apply to tangible assets, alternative or supplementary methods of specification are required for intangibles, providing examples relevant to software development (functional requirements, technical specs, performance metrics, scope). This addresses the ambiguity and allows the standard to be practically applied to a wider range of contemporary Istisna'a contracts involving intangible deliverables, consistent with the Shari'a principle of removing *Gharar* (uncertainty) from the subject matter.\n\n```\n# Proposal 2: Clarification on Inclusion of Project-Specific R&D Costs\n\n## Issue Identified\nParagraph 2/1(a) explicitly excludes research and development costs from Istisna'a contract costs. In the context of developing intangible assets like software, significant R&D is often integral to the production process of the specific asset being created under the contract, and its exclusion distorts the true cost of the Istisna'a asset.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nStatement of the Standard\n2.

(para. 2)\n\n## Rationale\nThe original exclusion of all R&D costs is problematic for Istisna'a contracts involving the creation of assets where R&D is a core component of the production process, such as complex software or novel machinery. This enhancement differentiates between general, non-contract-specific R&D (which should be expensed) and R&D that is specifically required for and directly attributable to the creation of the contracted Al-Masnoo'. Allowing the latter to be included in Istisna'a costs provides a more accurate representation of the cost of the asset being developed under the contract, aligning the accounting treatment with the economic substance of the transaction, particularly relevant for intangible assets.\n\n```\n# Proposal 3: Guidance on Measuring Progress for Intangible Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe standard's preference for the percentage-of-completion method relies on the ability to estimate contract costs and measure work completed with \"reasonable accuracy.\" This is inherently more challenging for intangible assets like complex software due to evolving requirements, technical uncertainties, and iterative development processes compared to traditional construction or manufacturing. This can force the use of the less preferred completed-contract method, potentially delaying profit recognition and misrepresenting the project's status.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nStatement of the Standard\n2.

A crucial condition for applying this method is that the expected cost of completing the contract is estimated with reasonable accuracy.

For complex intangible assets like software, progress is often better tracked through functional milestones, performance testing, or specific deliverables rather than purely cost incurred or physical units. This enhancement adds flexibility to the percentage-of-completion method by suggesting alternative, verifiable measures of progress applicable to intangible assets, acknowledging the challenges in cost estimation for such projects and providing clearer guidance on how \"reasonable accuracy\" might be achieved in this context. This supports the preferred method for profit recognition and provides more relevant information to financial statement users.\n\n```\n# Proposal 4: Clarification of Software Development Costs in Cost Categorization\n\n## Issue Identified\nThe standard's categorization of Istisna'a costs into direct and indirect costs, while excluding certain types of expenses, seems primarily designed for physical production. It lacks clarity on how costs typically incurred in intangible asset development, such as personnel costs (developer salaries), computing resources (cloud usage), software licenses, and data acquisition/processing, should be classified as direct or allocable indirect costs.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nStatement of the Standard\n2.

Research and development costs that are directly attributable to the specific Al-Masnoo\u2019 under the Istisna\u2019a contract and necessary for its production may be included in Istisna\u2019a contract costs. General or non-contract-specific research and development costs shall not be included. For intangible assets like software, direct costs may include personnel costs (e.g., salaries of developers, engineers) directly engaged in the production of Al-Masnoo\u2019, costs of computing resources specifically utilized for the project (e.g., cloud services for development, testing, training), and costs of project-specific third-party software licenses or data acquisition. (para. 2)\n\nAppendix (F)\nDefinitions\nIstisna\u2019a Work-in-Progress Account\nThis is an asset account in which the Istisna\u2019a contract costs are accumulated. Istisna'a contract costs include direct and allocable indirect costs incurred in producing Al-Masnoo'. For intangible assets, specific guidance on relevant costs is provided in paragraph 2/1(a). When the percentage-of-completion method is used, a portion of Istisna\u2019a profit commensurate with the work completed during a financial period is also debited to this account.\nIstisna\u2019a Costs Account\nThis is an asset account used when a parallel Istisna\u2019a exists.

A portion of the Istisna\u2019a profit commensurate with the work completed during a financial period is also debited to this account.\n\n## Rationale\nThe original standard's cost examples and definitions are heavily weighted towards physical manufacturing or construction. This creates ambiguity when applying the standard to software development, where the nature of costs is different. This enhancement provides specific examples of typical software development costs (personnel, computing, licenses, data) and clarifies how they should be considered direct or allocable indirect costs within the existing cost categorization framework. This provides necessary guidance for financial institutions applying FAS 10 to intangible asset development contracts, ensuring consistent and appropriate cost capitalization.\n\n```\n# Proposal 5: Clarification of Transfer of Ownership and Delivery for Intangible Assets\n\n## Issue Identified\nAppendix C, Paragraph 6 discusses the transfer of ownership and entitlement to payment, seemingly based on the concept of physical delivery or the contract being constituted. For intangible assets like software, \"delivery\" and \"transfer of ownership\" can be complex, involving phased deployments, licensing, intellectual property transfer, and acceptance testing, which differs from taking physical possession. This creates ambiguity regarding the timing of revenue recognition and asset transfer for software Istisna'a.\n\n## Original Text\n**Original Text:**\nAppendix (C)\nJuristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n6. Transfer of Ownership\n[...]\nThis is the view adopted by recent civil Islamic legislations, and modern transactions, whereby both the transfer of title of ownership is automatic and unconditional and Al-Sani\u2019 is entitled to the agreed upon amount once the contract is constituted.\n[...]\nOther jurists are of the view that Al-Sani\u2019 is entitled to the agreed upon amount once Al-Masnoo\u2019 is delivered to Al-Mustasni\u2019.\n[...]\n\n## Proposed Modified Text\n**Proposed Modified Text:**\nAppendix (C)\nJuristic Rules for Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a\n6.

Software delivery often involves granting usage rights (licenses), transferring associated intellectual property, and undergoing acceptance testing to ensure it meets specifications, rather than a simple handover of a physical item. This enhancement provides guidance on how \"delivery\" and \"transfer of ownership\" should be understood in the context of intangible assets, linking it to contractual milestones that signify the point at which Al-Mustasni' obtains effective control or benefit from the completed Al-Masnoo'. This clarifies the timing for potential revenue recognition and asset transfer in line with the specific nature of software contracts.\n```"

Transfer of Ownership\n[...]\nThis is the view adopted by recent civil Islamic legislations, and modern transactions, whereby both the transfer of title of ownership is automatic and unconditional and Al-Sani\u2019 is entitled to the agreed upon amount once the contract is constituted.\n[...]\nOther jurists are of the view that Al-Sani\u2019 is entitled to the agreed upon amount once Al-Masnoo\u2019 is delivered to Al-Mustasni\u2019.\nFor intangible assets like software, 'delivery' and 'transfer of ownership' should be interpreted based on the contractual terms which may include granting specific licenses, transferring intellectual property rights, successful completion of acceptance testing, or deployment on the Mustasni's systems, as these represent the practical equivalent of transfer of control or benefit.\n\n## Rationale\nThe concept of transfer of ownership and delivery is straightforward for physical goods but requires clarification for intangible assets like software. Software delivery often involves granting usage rights (licenses), transferring associated intellectual property, and undergoing acceptance testing to ensure it meets specifications, rather than a simple handover of a physical item. This enhancement provides guidance on how \"delivery\" and \"transfer of ownership\" should be understood in the context of intangible assets, linking it to contractual milestones that signify the point at which Al-Mustasni' obtains effective control or benefit from the completed Al-Masnoo'. This clarifies the timing for potential revenue recognition and asset transfer in line with the specific nature of software contracts.\n```",
        "validation_result": "# Validation Results\n\n## Primary Validation Assessment\nOkay, Standards Validator Agent commencing evaluation of the proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 concerning intangible assets, specifically software development.\n\n**Evaluation Framework:**\n\n1.  **Shariah Compliance:** Does the proposal adhere to core Islamic finance principles (no Riba, Gharar, Maysir) and specific FAS 10 Shariah requirements (specified subject matter, fixed price, etc.)?\n2.  **Consistency:** Is the proposal consistent with the existing text of FAS 10 and other relevant AAOIFI standards?\n3.  **Practical Implementation:** Is the proposed change practical and implementable by financial institutions?\n4.  **Reasoning:** Is the justification for the proposed change clear and sound?\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 1: Clarification of Subject Matter Definition for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Add supplementary criteria (functional/non-functional requirements, technical specs, performance metrics, scope) for defining the subject matter (Al-Masnoo') for intangible assets like software, alongside the existing criteria for tangible assets.\n*   **Relevant Text:** Appendix (C), 4/1/1.\n*   **Rationale:** The original criteria (kind, type, quality, quantity) are insufficient for intangibles, leading to Gharar. The proposal provides relevant, practical ways to specify intangible assets.\n\n*   **Validation Checks:**\n    *   **Shariah Compliance:** The core Shariah principle relevant here is the prohibition of **Gharar** (excessive uncertainty). A fundamental requirement for a valid Istisna'a contract is that the subject matter (Al-Masnoo') must be known and specified sufficiently to remove any significant lack of knowledge (\u062c\u0647\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0641\u0627\u062d\u0634\u0629). The original text's criteria are designed for tangible goods. Applying these rigidly to intangible assets like software would indeed fail to adequately define the subject matter, introducing significant uncertainty about what is being contracted for. The proposed supplementary criteria (functional requirements, technical specifications, performance metrics, scope) are precisely the methods used in modern contracts for intangible development (especially software) to define the subject matter and remove ambiguity. Therefore, this proposal directly supports and enhances compliance with the Shariah principle of mitigating Gharar in the context of contemporary assets. It does not introduce Riba, Maysir, or conflict with other core principles.\n    *   **Consistency:** The proposed text does not replace the original criteria but adds guidance for a specific asset class (intangibles) where the original criteria are less applicable. It maintains the *principle* of requiring the subject matter to be known and specified, adapting the *method* of specification to the nature of the asset. This is consistent with the standard's overall objective of providing accounting guidance for Istisna'a while adhering to Shariah rules. There is no conflict with other standards mentioned (FAS 4, FAS 7) as they deal with different contract types or different aspects of asset valuation (FAS 4 mentions valuing *existing* intangible assets in Musharaka capital, whereas FAS 10 deals with *creating* an intangible asset).\n    *   **Practical Implementation:** Defining software by functional/non-functional requirements, technical architecture, performance benchmarks, and scope is standard practice in the software development industry. This is highly practical and reflects the real-world methods used to contract for such assets.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The rationale correctly identifies the gap in the current standard for intangible assets and proposes a practical, Shariah-compliant solution by providing relevant specification criteria that effectively remove Gharar for software Istisna'a.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED.**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal directly addresses a critical ambiguity in applying FAS 10 to intangible assets, which are increasingly relevant in modern finance. It enhances compliance with the Shariah principle of removing Gharar by providing practical and relevant methods for specifying the subject matter (Al-Masnoo') for software. It is consistent with the standard's intent and structure and is highly implementable based on industry practice.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 2: Clarification on Inclusion of Project-Specific R&D Costs**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Modify the exclusion of R&D costs in Statement of Standard, 2/1(a), to allow inclusion of R&D costs directly attributable to the specific Al-Masnoo' under the contract and necessary for its production, while still excluding general or non-contract-specific R&D.\n*   **Relevant Text:** Statement of the Standard, 2/1(a).\n*   **Rationale:** Excluding all R&D distorts the true cost for contracts where R&D is integral to the production of the specific asset, especially for complex or novel assets like advanced software. Allowing project-specific R&D provides a more accurate cost representation.\n\n*   **Validation Checks:**\n    *   **Shariah Compliance:** Shariah does not prescribe specific accounting cost classifications. The validity of the Istisna'a contract itself is based on principles like fixed price, specified subject matter, etc., which are not affected by this proposal. The proposal concerns the *accounting treatment* of costs incurred in executing a valid Istisna'a contract. Capitalizing costs directly related to creating the specific asset (the Masnoo') is a standard accounting practice aimed at accurately reflecting the cost of the asset being produced. Excluding R&D that is *essential* and *specific* to creating the contracted asset could lead to understating the asset's cost and distorting the matching of costs and revenues (relevant to the percentage-of-completion method preferred in FAS 10, Appendix E). This refinement enhances the accuracy and transparency of financial reporting, which aligns with the broader Shariah principles of fairness and clarity in dealings. It does not introduce Riba, Gharar, or Maysir.\n    *   **Consistency:** The proposal modifies 2/1(a) by refining the exclusion of R&D. This distinction between general R&D (expensed) and project-specific development costs (potentially capitalized as part of the asset cost) is a common principle in accounting for intangible asset development (e.g., under IFRS). Applying this distinction to Istisna'a costs makes the standard more robust when applied to complex, innovative projects. It appears consistent with the overall accounting framework of FAS 10, which aims to capitalize costs incurred in producing the Masnoo'.\n    *   **Practical Implementation:** Distinguishing between general R&D and project-specific R&D/development costs requires clear project definitions and cost tracking, which is standard practice in managing development projects, including software. It is implementable, although it requires careful internal cost allocation systems.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The rationale correctly identifies that R&D is often an integral part of producing complex, custom assets and that a blanket exclusion distorts the true cost. The proposal provides a reasonable distinction that aligns accounting treatment with the economic reality of such contracts.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED.**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal improves the accuracy of Istisna'a cost measurement for contracts involving significant project-specific development work, particularly relevant for intangible assets. This refinement aligns accounting treatment with the economic substance of the transaction and supports better financial reporting without violating any Shariah principles. It is practical and consistent with accounting principles applied to development costs.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 3: Guidance on Measuring Progress for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Add guidance to Statement of Standard, 2/3/1/1 and Appendix E, suggesting alternative verifiable measures of progress for intangible assets (milestones, functional completion, performance benchmarks) in addition to or instead of traditional cost-based inputs, to support the application of the percentage-of-completion method.\n*   **Relevant Text:** Statement of the Standard, 2/3/1/1; Appendix (E), Basis for Conclusions.\n*   **Rationale:** Traditional methods of measuring progress are difficult for intangibles like software, hindering the use of the preferred percentage-of-completion method. Alternative measures provide practical ways to achieve \"reasonable accuracy\" and enable more relevant profit recognition.\n\n*   **Validation Checks:**\n    *   **Shariah Compliance:** The choice of accounting method for profit recognition (percentage-of-completion vs. completed contract) is primarily an accounting issue, not a direct Shariah principle, as long as it reflects actual work completed and does not involve recognizing profit on transactions that have not yet matured or where significant Gharar remains regarding completion. Istisna'a profit is fixed at the outset. The percentage-of-completion method allocates this fixed profit over the contract period based on progress. The proposal aims to provide valid ways to measure *progress* for intangible assets. Using objectively verifiable milestones, functional completion, or performance benchmarks are legitimate ways to assess how much of the contracted work has been completed for software. This supports the accurate allocation of the fixed profit commensurate with the work done, which is consistent with the intent of the percentage-of-completion method as described in Appendix E (\"proportion to the work completed\"). It does not introduce Riba (profit is fixed, not interest), Gharar (it aims to make the progress measurement *less* uncertain), or Maysir.\n    *   **Consistency:** The proposal supports the application of the percentage-of-completion method, which FAS 10 identifies as the *preferred* method (Appendix E). It provides necessary clarification on how the condition of \"reasonable accuracy\" in measuring completion can be met for intangible assets, where cost-based methods alone might be misleading or impractical. This enhances the applicability and robustness of the standard's preferred accounting method. It is consistent with the standard's framework.\n    *   **Practical Implementation:** Measuring project progress by milestones, functional deliverables, or performance metrics is a standard, widely used practice in software development projects. This is highly practical and often more meaningful than purely cost-based measures for intangible deliverables.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The rationale correctly identifies the difficulty of applying traditional progress measurement to intangibles and the consequence of being forced into the less informative completed-contract method. The proposed alternative measures are standard in the relevant industry and provide a practical path to applying the preferred accounting method accurately.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED.**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal provides essential practical guidance for applying the preferred percentage-of-completion accounting method to Istisna'a contracts for intangible assets. By suggesting alternative, verifiable measures of progress, it improves the accuracy and relevance of financial reporting for such contracts, fully consistent with Shariah principles and the intent of the standard. It is highly implementable.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 4: Clarification of Software Development Costs in Cost Categorization**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Add specific examples of typical software development costs (personnel, computing resources, software licenses, data acquisition) to the definition of direct and allocable indirect costs in Statement of Standard, 2/1(a) and Appendix F.\n*   **Relevant Text:** Statement of the Standard, 2/1(a); Appendix (F), Definitions.\n*   **Rationale:** The original standard lacks clarity on how costs specific to intangible development should be classified, creating ambiguity. The proposal provides examples to guide classification. (Note: This proposal incorporates the R&D clarification from Proposal 2, but the core distinct element here is the list of cost examples).\n\n*   **Validation Checks:**\n    *   **Shariah Compliance:** Similar to Proposal 2, this concerns accounting cost classification and does not affect the Shariah validity of the Istisna'a contract itself. Providing clear examples of costs helps ensure accurate and consistent measurement of the cost of production (of the Masnoo'). This supports the principles of transparency and accurate financial reporting, which are compatible with Shariah. It does not involve Riba, Gharar, or Maysir.\n    *   **Consistency:** The proposal adds specific examples of costs relevant to intangible assets within the existing framework of direct and indirect costs. This is consistent with the structure of the standard (2/1(a) defines costs) and the definitions provided in Appendix F. It doesn't alter the fundamental cost principles but provides necessary detail for a specific context (intangible assets).\n    *   **Practical Implementation:** Identifying and classifying costs like personnel time, computing resource usage, and specific licenses or data purchases as direct or allocable indirect project costs is standard practice in project accounting for software development. This is practical and implementable, requiring appropriate internal systems.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The rationale correctly identifies the need for specific guidance on cost classification for intangible assets. The examples provided are relevant and common in software development and fit logically within the standard's existing cost categories.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED.**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal provides valuable and necessary practical guidance by offering concrete examples of how common software development costs should be classified within the existing Istisna'a cost framework. This enhances clarity, consistency, and accuracy in accounting for intangible asset development contracts, without conflicting with Shariah principles or other parts of the standard. It is highly implementable.\n\n---\n\n**Proposal 5: Clarification of Transfer of Ownership and Delivery for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Proposed Change:** Add clarification to Appendix C, 6, explaining that 'delivery' and 'transfer of ownership' for intangible assets like software should be interpreted based on contractual terms (licensing, IP transfer, acceptance testing, deployment) that represent the transfer of control or benefit.\n*   **Relevant Text:** Appendix (C), 6.\n*   **Rationale:** The concept of delivery is physical in the original text but needs interpretation for intangibles like software, where transfer involves licensing, IP, and testing. Clarification is needed for timing of revenue recognition and asset transfer.\n\n*   **Validation Checks:**\n    *   **Shariah Compliance:** In Istisna'a, the Sani' becomes entitled to the price (or installments) upon completion and delivery of the Masnoo', or as otherwise contractually agreed upon. The key point from a Shariah perspective is that the customer (Mustasni') receives the agreed-upon asset, and the Sani' fulfills their obligation to produce and deliver it according to specifications. For intangible assets, the practical fulfillment of this obligation and the transfer of effective control or benefit occurs through mechanisms like granting licenses, transferring necessary IP rights, and ensuring the asset meets specifications via acceptance testing and deployment. These contractual events serve the same purpose as physical delivery for tangible goods \u2013 they signify the point at which the Mustasni' has received what was contracted for and the Sani' has completed performance. Clarifying that 'delivery' for intangibles refers to these contractual triggers aligns the standard with the economic reality of the transaction and ensures that the timing of entitlement and revenue recognition is linked to the actual fulfillment of the Sani's obligation and transfer of benefit to the Mustasni'. This addresses potential Gharar related to the completion and handover point for non-physical assets. It does not introduce Riba, Maysir, or conflict with other core principles.\n    *   **Consistency:** The proposal adds an interpretation of existing terms ('delivery', 'transfer of ownership') for a specific asset type (intangibles) within Appendix C, 6. It does not alter the fundamental principles of Istisna'a but clarifies their application. This clarification is crucial for the consistent application of revenue recognition principles (e.g., percentage-of-completion or completed contract methods, which ultimately rely on the concept of completion and transfer) to intangible assets.\n    *   **Practical Implementation:** Contracts for software development routinely define \"delivery\" and \"acceptance\" in terms of milestones, testing phases, deployment events, and transfer of rights (licenses, IP). The proposed interpretation is entirely practical and reflects standard industry practice.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The rationale correctly identifies the ambiguity of applying the physical concept of delivery to intangible assets and the need for clarification regarding the point at which the Sani's obligation is fulfilled and the Mustasni' gains control/benefit. The proposed interpretation, linking delivery to contractual events signifying transfer of control or benefit, is sound and practical.\n\n*   **Final Decision:** **APPROVED.**\n    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal provides essential clarification on the concept of 'delivery' and 'transfer of ownership' for intangible assets within FAS 10, which is crucial for accurate application of the standard's revenue recognition and asset transfer principles. It aligns the standard with the practical realities of contracting for intangible assets in a manner fully consistent with Shariah principles. It is highly implementable.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nAll five proposed enhancements are well-reasoned, directly address practical issues in applying FAS 10 to intangible assets like software, enhance clarity and accuracy in accounting for such contracts, maintain consistency with the standard's framework, and are fully compatible with Shariah principles by reducing Gharar and supporting transparency. They are based on practical, implementable methods common in relevant industries.\n\nTherefore, all five proposals are Recommended for Approval.\n\n## Additional Shariah Compliance Insights\nThe following insights were provided by specialized Islamic Finance Compliance resources with access to Quran and Sunnah references:\n\nAll five proposals appear to be compliant with Shariah principles, specifically regarding Istisna'a contracts, and aim to reduce *Gharar* (uncertainty) and ensure fairness in transactions involving intangible assets like software. Here's a breakdown:\n\n**General Principles Underpinning the Analysis:**\n\n*   **Permissibility of Contracts ( \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0635\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0628\u0627\u062d\u0629 ):**  The general rule in Islamic jurisprudence is that contracts are permissible unless explicitly prohibited by the Quran or Sunnah. These proposals don't introduce anything explicitly prohibited.\n*   **Removal of *Gharar* ( \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0631 ):**  A core principle in Islamic finance is the avoidance of excessive uncertainty or ambiguity (*Gharar*) in contracts.  The Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibited transactions involving *Gharar*.  These proposals directly address *Gharar* by clarifying definitions and processes for intangible assets.\n*   **Fairness and Justice ( \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0625\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0646 ):**  Islamic finance emphasizes fairness and justice in all dealings.  These proposals aim to ensure that accounting practices accurately reflect the economic reality of software development, preventing unfair outcomes for either party in the Istisna'a contract.\n*   **Substance over Form ( \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0627\u0635\u062f ):**  Islamic jurisprudence emphasizes the intent and substance of a transaction over its mere form.  The proposals focus on aligning accounting treatment with the underlying economic substance of software Istisna'a contracts.\n*   **Custom and Usage ( \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0645\u062d\u0643\u0645\u0629 ):**  Customary practices (*Urf*) are considered a source of law in Islamic jurisprudence, provided they do not contradict explicit Islamic texts or principles.  The proposals acknowledge the unique characteristics of the software industry and adapt existing rules to fit those customs.\n\n**Proposal-by-Proposal Analysis:**\n\n**Proposal 1: Clarification of Subject Matter Definition for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Shariah Compliance:** Compliant.  The proposal directly addresses *Gharar* by providing clearer guidelines for defining *Al-Masnoo'* (the subject matter) in software Istisna'a contracts.  The original definition, geared towards tangible assets, creates ambiguity for intangibles.  Specifying functional requirements, technical specifications, performance metrics, and scope reduces this ambiguity.\n*   **Quran/Sunnah Reference:**  While there's no specific verse or Hadith detailing how to define software, the general prohibition of *Gharar* (uncertainty) in transactions is well-established.  The Quran emphasizes clarity and honesty in dealings: *\"O you who believe! When you deal with each other, in transactions valid for a stated term, reduce it to writing...\"* (Quran 2:282). This verse, while about debt, highlights the importance of clear documentation to avoid disputes, a principle applicable to defining the subject matter of a contract.\n*   **Justification:**  By ensuring a clear understanding of what is being produced, the proposal prevents disputes and ensures that both parties are aware of their obligations.\n\n**Proposal 2: Clarification on Inclusion of Project-Specific R&D Costs**\n\n*   **Shariah Compliance:** Compliant.  The proposal distinguishes between general R&D (which remains excluded) and R&D directly attributable to the specific *Al-Masnoo'*.  Including the latter provides a more accurate reflection of the cost of production, aligning with the principle of fairness.\n*   **Quran/Sunnah Reference:**  The principle of fairness and avoiding unjust enrichment is central to Islamic finance.  The Quran states: *\"And do not consume one another's wealth unjustly...\"* (Quran 2:188).  Excluding project-specific R&D could lead to an inaccurate representation of costs, potentially benefiting one party unfairly.\n*   **Justification:**  This proposal ensures that the cost of the *Al-Masnoo'* accurately reflects the resources used in its creation, promoting fairness and transparency.\n\n**Proposal 3: Guidance on Measuring Progress for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Shariah Compliance:** Compliant.  The proposal addresses the difficulty of applying traditional percentage-of-completion methods to software development.  Suggesting alternative, verifiable measures of progress (milestones, functional completion, performance benchmarks) allows for more accurate profit recognition and avoids delaying recognition unnecessarily.\n*   **Quran/Sunnah Reference:**  The emphasis on accurate measurement and avoiding deception is relevant here.  The Quran warns against giving short measure: *\"Woe to those who give less [than due], Those who, when they take a measure from people, take in full, But when they give a measure or weight to them, cause loss.\"* (Quran 83:1-3).  While about physical measures, the principle extends to accurately measuring progress in a contract.\n*   **Justification:**  By allowing for more appropriate measures of progress, the proposal ensures that profit recognition is aligned with the actual work completed, preventing misrepresentation of the project's status.\n\n**Proposal 4: Clarification of Software Development Costs in Cost Categorization**\n\n*   **Shariah Compliance:** Compliant.  The proposal provides specific examples of software development costs (personnel, computing, licenses, data) and clarifies their classification as direct or allocable indirect costs.  This reduces ambiguity and ensures consistent cost capitalization.\n*   **Quran/Sunnah Reference:**  The general principle of transparency and clear accounting is relevant.  The Quran encourages detailed record-keeping in financial transactions (Quran 2:282).  This proposal contributes to clearer accounting by providing specific guidance on cost categorization.\n*   **Justification:**  This proposal promotes transparency and consistency in accounting for software development costs, ensuring that financial statements accurately reflect the economic reality of the Istisna'a contract.\n\n**Proposal 5: Clarification of Transfer of Ownership and Delivery for Intangible Assets**\n\n*   **Shariah Compliance:** Compliant.  The proposal clarifies that \"delivery\" and \"transfer of ownership\" for software should be interpreted based on contractual terms, such as granting licenses, transferring IP, or successful acceptance testing.  This aligns the accounting treatment with the point at which the *Mustasni'* (buyer) obtains effective control or benefit.\n*   **Quran/Sunnah Reference:**  The principle of fulfilling contractual obligations is paramount in Islam.  The Quran states: *\"O you who believe! Fulfill [all] contracts.\"* (Quran 5:1).  This proposal ensures that the transfer of ownership is recognized when the contractual obligations related to the software are substantially fulfilled.\n*   **Justification:**  This proposal ensures that revenue recognition and asset transfer are aligned with the point at which the *Mustasni'* gains control and benefit from the software, fulfilling the contractual obligations and promoting fairness.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll five proposals are consistent with Shariah principles. They address the unique characteristics of intangible assets like software within the framework of Istisna'a contracts, reducing *Gharar*, promoting fairness, and ensuring that accounting practices accurately reflect the economic substance of the transactions. They do not contradict any explicit Quranic verses or Hadiths and are aligned with the broader principles of Islamic finance.\n\nReferences:\n- FAS Document Chunks: 152672_Al-Masri-Book.pdf (Page 37), 152672_Al-Masri-Book.pdf (Page 7), 152672_Al-Masri-Book.pdf (Page 351), 152672_Al-Masri-Book.pdf (Page 347), 152672_Al-Masri-Book.pdf (Page 29), 152672_Al-Masri-Book.pdf (Page 349), 152672_Al-Masri-Book.pdf (Page 5), 152672_Al-Masri-Book.pdf (Page 348)\n\n\n## Final Decision\nAfter reviewing both the primary assessment and specialized Islamic Finance Compliance insights, the final decision is: APPROVED"

        "cross_standard_analysis": "## Cross-Standard Impact Analysis\n\nThe proposed enhancements to FAS 10 are primarily focused on adapting the standard to the unique characteristics of *Istisna'a* contracts involving the development of intangible assets, specifically using software development as the key example. The proposals address:\n1.  Clarifying the definition and specification criteria for intangible subject matter (Al-Masnoo').\n2.  Allowing the capitalization of project-specific research and development costs as part of Istisna'a costs.\n3.  Providing guidance on measuring progress for intangible assets using methods suitable for their development lifecycle (e.g., milestones, functional completion) to facilitate the use of the percentage-of-completion method.\n4.  Clarifying the categorization of typical software development costs (personnel, computing, licenses, data) within the direct/indirect cost framework.\n5.  Clarifying the interpretation of \"transfer of ownership\" and \"delivery\" for intangible assets based on contractual terms signifying control transfer (e.g., licensing, IP transfer, acceptance testing).\n\nThe core impact of these proposals is to broaden the practical applicability of FAS 10 beyond traditional manufacturing and construction to encompass the creation of digital and other intangible assets, while remaining consistent with the underlying Shari'a principles of Istisna'a (contract for manufacturing/development of a specified item).\n\n**Analysis of Impact on Other Standards:**\n\n*   **FAS 4 (Musharakah and Mudarabah):** FAS 4 deals with partnership arrangements. While Musharakah capital can include tangible or intangible assets (as noted in Appendix D of FAS 4, requiring valuation of intangible assets), FAS 4 does not address the *development* or *creation* of assets within the partnership in the detailed manner that FAS 10 addresses manufacturing/development. The proposed FAS 10 enhancements provide specific guidance on identifying, costing, measuring progress, and transferring *developed* intangible assets. This guidance could serve as useful supplementary reference if a Musharakah/Mudarabah venture's objective is the development of such an asset, particularly regarding the valuation of intangible contributions or assets created by the partnership. However, it does not contradict or directly synergize with the core principles of profit/loss sharing, capital contribution, or management inherent in FAS 4. The impact is indirect and limited to scenarios where intangible asset *development* is the focus of the partnership, which is not the primary scope of FAS 4.\n    *   *Potential Contradiction:* None identified. The standards address different types of contracts.\n    *   *Potential Synergy:* Low. Could provide relevant guidance on valuation and accounting for intangible assets *within* a Musharakah if the partnership's activity involves their development.\n\n*   **FAS 7 (Salam and Parallel Salam):** FAS 7 governs forward sale contracts for *fungible* goods or specified *benefits* with upfront payment. Salam is fundamentally different from Istisna'a. Salam is for existing, typically fungible, described items deliverable in the future, whereas Istisna'a is for the manufacturing or creation of a *custom* item. Applying Salam to complex, unique intangible assets like custom software is generally not considered permissible under Shari'a. The proposed FAS 10 enhancements are specific to the *creation* process and the unique nature of custom intangible assets. These issues (detailed specification of unique features, development costs, measuring development progress, transfer of custom IP) do not arise in standard Salam transactions focused on fungible items.\n    *   *Potential Contradiction:* None identified. The transaction types are distinct.\n    *   *Potential Synergy:* None. The principles and accounting treatments in the FAS 10 proposals are not relevant to the nature of Salam contracts.\n\n*   **FAS 28 (Murabaha and Other Deferred Payment Sales):** FAS 28 covers cost-plus sales of *existing* assets. Murabaha requires the seller (Islamic bank) to own the asset before selling it to the buyer. It is a sale of an existing item, not a contract for its creation or development. The issues addressed in the FAS 10 proposals \u2013 defining a custom item to be built, accounting for development costs, measuring progress *during* development, and clarifying delivery of a *newly built* item \u2013 are not relevant to a Murabaha transaction, which deals with the sale of an asset that already exists.\n    *   *Potential Contradiction:* None identified. The transaction types are distinct.\n    *   *Potential Synergy:* None. The principles and accounting treatments in the FAS 10 proposals are not relevant to the nature of Murabaha contracts.\n\n*   **FAS 32 (Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek):** FAS 32 deals with the leasing of assets, primarily tangible assets, and the transfer of their *benefit* (Manfa'ah). While modern Islamic finance may apply Ijarah principles to the use of intangible assets (like software licenses), FAS 32 focuses on the accounting for the *lease* of an asset, not its *creation*. The proposed FAS 10 enhancements relate entirely to the manufacturing/development phase of an asset's lifecycle. There is no direct conflict or synergy. If an institution develops an intangible asset via Istisna'a (governed by FAS 10) and subsequently leases its use (governed by FAS 32, if applicable), the standards would apply to different phases of the asset's life. The clarification of \"delivery\" in FAS 10 (Proposal 5) might have a conceptual parallel to the 'delivery' of an asset for lease in FAS 32, but the context is different (completion of creation vs. commencement of lease).\n    *   *Potential Contradiction:* None identified. The standards address different types of contracts (creation vs. leasing).\n    *   *Potential Synergy:* None. The principles and accounting treatments in the FAS 10 proposals are not relevant to the nature of Ijarah contracts.\n\nIn summary, the proposed enhancements to FAS 10 are highly specific to the Istisna'a contract and its application to intangible asset development. They do not appear to contradict or create significant accounting synergies with the other selected standards (FAS 4, 7, 28, 32), as these standards govern fundamentally different types of Islamic finance transactions. The impact is primarily contained within FAS 10 itself, increasing its clarity and applicability to a modern context.\n\n## Compatibility Matrix\n\n| Standard ID | Impact Level | Impact Type |\n|-------------|--------------|-------------|\n| FAS 4       | Low          | Synergy     |\n| FAS 7       | None         | None        |\n| FAS 10      | High         | Synergy     |\n| FAS 28      | None         | None        |\n| FAS 32      | None         | None        |\n\n*Note: Impact on FAS 10 itself is High Synergy as the proposals enhance and clarify the standard's applicability.*\n\n## Recommendations\n\nGiven the low to non-existent direct impact on the reviewed standards (FAS 4, 7, 28, 32), recommendations for maintaining cross-standard consistency are general rather than addressing specific conflicts.\n\n1.  **Maintain Consistent Terminology for Intangible Assets:** While the other standards may not extensively cover intangible assets, ensure that any future revisions or interpretations across all standards consistently use defined terms (e.g., \"intangible asset\") and acknowledge their potential existence in various contract types where Shari'a permits (like capital contribution in Musharakah or as a developed asset under Istisna'a).\n2.  **Cross-Reference Relevant Guidance:** If future standards or interpretations in other areas (like FAS 4 regarding Musharakah assets) require detailed accounting guidance for intangible assets that are *developed*, consider referencing the specific guidance provided in FAS 10 regarding cost capitalization, progress measurement, and delivery/transfer for such assets, where applicable and aligned with the contract type. This would leverage the detailed work done in FAS 10 for consistency.\n3.  **Ensure Shari'a Consistency:** Continuously verify that the application of accounting principles for intangible assets across all relevant standards remains consistent with the underlying Shari'a principles governing each specific contract type (Istisna'a, Musharakah, etc.). The clarification in FAS 10 regarding the nature of Al-Masnoo' for intangibles should align with the Shari'a principles for valid subject matter in Istisna'a.",

    "cross_standard_analysis": "## Cross-Standard Impact Analysis\n\nThe proposed enhancements to FAS 10 are primarily focused on adapting the standard to the unique characteristics of *Istisna'a* contracts involving the development of intangible assets, specifically using software development as the key example. The proposals address:\n1.  Clarifying the definition and specification criteria for intangible subject matter (Al-Masnoo').\n2.  Allowing the capitalization of project-specific research and development costs as part of Istisna'a costs.\n3.  Providing guidance on measuring progress for intangible assets using methods suitable for their development lifecycle (e.g., milestones, functional completion) to facilitate the use of the percentage-of-completion method.\n4.  Clarifying the categorization of typical software development costs (personnel, computing, licenses, data) within the direct/indirect cost framework.\n5.  Clarifying the interpretation of \"transfer of ownership\" and \"delivery\" for intangible assets based on contractual terms signifying control transfer (e.g., licensing, IP transfer, acceptance testing).\n\nThe core impact of these proposals is to broaden the practical applicability of FAS 10 beyond traditional manufacturing and construction to encompass the creation of digital and other intangible assets, while remaining consistent with the underlying Shari'a principles of Istisna'a (contract for manufacturing/development of a specified item).\n\n**Analysis of Impact on Other Standards:**\n\n*   **FAS 4 (Musharakah and Mudarabah):** FAS 4 deals with partnership arrangements. While Musharakah capital can include tangible or intangible assets (as noted in Appendix D of FAS 4, requiring valuation of intangible assets), FAS 4 does not address the *development* or *creation* of assets within the partnership in the detailed manner that FAS 10 addresses manufacturing/development. The proposed FAS 10 enhancements provide specific guidance on identifying, costing, measuring progress, and transferring *developed* intangible assets. This guidance could serve as useful supplementary reference if a Musharakah/Mudarabah venture's objective is the development of such an asset, particularly regarding the valuation of intangible contributions or assets created by the partnership. However, it does not contradict or directly synergize with the core principles of profit/loss sharing, capital contribution, or management inherent in FAS 4. The impact is indirect and limited to scenarios where intangible asset *development* is the focus of the partnership, which is not the primary scope of FAS 4.\n    *   *Potential Contradiction:* None identified. The standards address different types of contracts.\n    *   *Potential Synergy:* Low. Could provide relevant guidance on valuation and accounting for intangible assets *within* a Musharakah if the partnership's activity involves their development.\n\n*   **FAS 7 (Salam and Parallel Salam):** FAS 7 governs forward sale contracts for *fungible* goods or specified *benefits* with upfront payment. Salam is fundamentally different from Istisna'a. Salam is for existing, typically fungible, described items deliverable in the future, whereas Istisna'a is for the manufacturing or creation of a *custom* item. Applying Salam to complex, unique intangible assets like custom software is generally not considered permissible under Shari'a. The proposed FAS 10 enhancements are specific to the *creation* process and the unique nature of custom intangible assets. These issues (detailed specification of unique features, development costs, measuring development progress, transfer of custom IP) do not arise in standard Salam transactions focused on fungible items.\n    *   *Potential Contradiction:* None identified. The transaction types are distinct.\n    *   *Potential Synergy:* None. The principles and accounting treatments in the FAS 10 proposals are not relevant to the nature of Salam contracts.\n\n*   **FAS 28 (Murabaha and Other Deferred Payment Sales):** FAS 28 covers cost-plus sales of *existing* assets. Murabaha requires the seller (Islamic bank) to own the asset before selling it to the buyer. It is a sale of an existing item, not a contract for its creation or development. The issues addressed in the FAS 10 proposals \u2013 defining a custom item to be built, accounting for development costs, measuring progress *during* development, and clarifying delivery of a *newly built* item \u2013 are not relevant to a Murabaha transaction, which deals with the sale of an asset that already exists.\n    *   *Potential Contradiction:* None identified. The transaction types are distinct.\n    *   *Potential Synergy:* None. The principles and accounting treatments in the FAS 10 proposals are not relevant to the nature of Murabaha contracts.\n\n*   **FAS 32 (Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek):** FAS 32 deals with the leasing of assets, primarily tangible assets, and the transfer of their *benefit* (Manfa'ah). While modern Islamic finance may apply Ijarah principles to the use of intangible assets (like software licenses), FAS 32 focuses on the accounting for the *lease* of an asset, not its *creation*. The proposed FAS 10 enhancements relate entirely to the manufacturing/development phase of an asset's lifecycle. There is no direct conflict or synergy.
