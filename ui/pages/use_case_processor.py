                            1. The cost of the generator includes the purchase price plus import tax and freight charges:
                               - Purchase price: $450,000

                            2. Since this is an Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek arrangement:
                               - The asset should be recognized at cost minus the nominal transfer amount
                               - Right-of-Use (ROU) asset value: $492,000 - $3,000 = $489,000
