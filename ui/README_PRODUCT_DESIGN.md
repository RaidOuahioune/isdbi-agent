# Financial Product Design Advisor (Challenge 4)

This document provides information on the Financial Product Design Advisor feature, which addresses Challenge 4 of the ISDB-AAOIFI Hackathon.

## Feature Overview

The Financial Product Design Advisor helps users conceptualize new Islamic financial products based on specific requirements. The advisor:

1. Suggests suitable Islamic contract structures based on user-defined parameters
2. Highlights relevant AAOIFI FAS implications and accounting considerations
3. Provides initial Shariah compliance checkpoints and identifies potential concerns
4. Offers implementation guidance and next steps

## Getting Started

To use the Financial Product Design Advisor:

1. Launch the application: `cd ui && streamlit run app.py`
2. From the sidebar, select "ðŸ’¼ Product Design Advisor (Challenge 4)"
3. Fill in the product requirements form
4. Click "Design Product" to generate recommendations

## Feature Components

The Financial Product Design Advisor consists of:

### Backend Components
- **ProductDesignAdvisorAgent** (`components/agents/product_design.py`): Analyzes requirements and generates product designs
- **ProductComplianceCheckAgent** (`components/agents/compliance_check.py`): Evaluates Shariah compliance of proposed products
- **Data Models** (`models/product_design.py`): Structured data schemas and product-related constants

### UI Components
- **Product Design Page** (`ui/pages/product_design.py`): Main UI for the feature
- **Utility Functions** (`ui/utils/product_design_utils.py`): Handles communication between UI and agents
- **Session State Management** (`ui/states/session_state.py`): Manages product design data

## User Interface

The Product Design UI includes:

1. **Requirements Form**: Input for product specifications
2. **Visualizations**: Interactive diagrams of contract structures
3. **Tabbed Results Display**:
   - Product Overview
   - Structure & Contracts
   - AAOIFI Standards
   - Shariah Compliance
   - Implementation Steps
4. **Saved Designs Management**: View and reload past designs

## Testing

To test the Product Design Advisor:

1. Run the automated tests: `python tests/run_product_design_tests.py`
2. View the test cases in `tests/product_design_test_cases.md`
3. Manually test using the demo script in `documentation/product_design_demo.md`

## Implementation Details

### Direct Agent Approach

The Product Design Advisor uses a direct agent approach rather than the agent graph and router. This approach:

- Simplifies the implementation
- Improves reliability
- Makes debugging easier
- Follows the pattern used in other challenges

### Visualization Features

The UI includes interactive visualizations that:

- Show contract structures as flow diagrams
- Adapt based on the recommended contract type
- Provide implementation timelines
- Offer visual analytics of contract types

### Standards Integration

The advisor integrates AAOIFI standards by:

1. Mapping contracts to relevant FAS documents (4, 7, 10, 28, 32)
2. Extracting key accounting and disclosure requirements
3. Highlighting standards-specific compliance considerations

## Example Use Cases

The Financial Product Design Advisor is designed for:

1. **Banking Product Teams**: Developing new retail financial products
2. **Islamic Finance Startups**: Creating innovative Shariah-compliant offerings
3. **Financial Advisors**: Designing custom solutions for specific client needs
4. **Educators**: Teaching Islamic finance product structures

## Extending the Feature

The Product Design Advisor can be extended by:

1. Adding more detailed contract templates
2. Incorporating additional AAOIFI standards
3. Building export functionality for product specifications
4. Adding collaborative features for team-based product design

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that all dependencies are installed
2. Ensure the required libraries are available (plotly, pandas)
3. Check the console for any error messages
4. Try running with the fallback implementation if direct agent calls fail
