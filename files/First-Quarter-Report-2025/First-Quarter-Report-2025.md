#### FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 39

The fair value of quoted securities other than the collect model, is based on quoted market price. Quoted securities classified under held to collect model are carried at amortised cost.

In the opinion of the management, the fair value of the remaining financial liabilities are not significantly different from their carrying values since these assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or re-priced over short term.

#### 39.1 Fair value of financial / non-financial assets

The Bank measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements:

Level 1: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Fair value measurements using included within Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3: Fair value measurements using input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable inputs).

The table below analyses the financial assets carried at fair values, by valuation methods. For financial assets, the Bank essentially caries its investments in Sukuk at fair values. Valuation of investments is carried out as per guidelines specified by the SBP. In case of non-financial assets, the Bank has adopted revaluation model (as per IAS 16) in respect of land and building.
