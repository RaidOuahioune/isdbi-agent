Whenever the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017, or the directives issued by the SBP and the SECP differ with the requirements of IAS 34, IFRS, or IFAS, the requirements of the Banking Companies Ordinance, 1962, the Companies Act, 2017, and the said directives shall prevail.

The SBP has deferred the applicability of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 40, 'Investment Property' for banking companies through BSD Circular Letter No. 10 dated August 26, 2002, till further instructions. Further, the SECP has deferred the applicability of International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' on banks through its notification S.R.O 411(1)/2008 dated April 28, 2008. The State Bank of Pakistan through BPRD Circular No. 04 of 2015 dated February 25, 2015, has deferred the applicability of Islamic Financial Accounting Standard-3 for Profit and Loss Sharing on Deposits (IFAS-3) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) and notified by the SECP, vide their SRO No. 571 of 2013 dated June 12, 2013, for Institutions offering Islamic Financial Services (IIFS). Accordingly, the requirements of these standards have not been considered in the preparation of these condensed interim financial statements.

The disclosures made in these condensed interim financial statements have been limited based on a format prescribed by the SBP vide BPRD Circular Letter No. 2 dated February 09, 2023, and the requirements of IAS 34 "Interim Financial Reporting". They do not include all the information and disclosures required in the preparation of annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the annual audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The Bank believes that there is no significant doubt on the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the condensed interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

In addition, obligations in respect of lease liabilities are carried at present value and right-of-use assets which are initially measured at an amount equal to the corresponding lease liability and depreciated over the respective lease terms.

#### Measurement of Fair Values

The Bank has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. The management regularly reviews significant observable and unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. Fair values are categorized into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques. The valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities is categorized and disclosed in note 40.

These condensed interim financial statements are presented in Pakistani Rupees, which is the Bank's functional and presentation currency. The amounts are rounded off to the nearest thousand rupees except as stated otherwise.

#### Standards, Interpretations, and Amendments to Approved Accounting Standards Not Yet Effective

## Fair Value Measurements

### 39.1 Fair Value of Financial / Non-Financial Assets

#### Fair Value Hierarchy

- **Level 1**: Fair value measurements using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- **Level 2**: Fair value measurements using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).
- **Level 3**: Fair value measurements using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The table below analyzes the financial and non-financial assets carried at fair values, by valuation methods. For financial assets, the Bank essentially carries its investments in Sukuk and equity securities at fair values. Valuation of investments is carried out as per guidelines specified by the SBP. In the case of non-financial assets, the Bank has adopted the revaluation model (as per IAS 16) in respect of land and building.

- **Valuation Techniques and Input Used**

  - **Fully Paid-up Ordinary Shares**  
    Fair values of investments in listed equity securities are valued on the basis of closing quoted market prices available at the Pakistan Stock Exchange.

  - **Ijarah Sukuks (GOP Ijarah Sukuks and Other Ijarah Sukuks)**  
    Fair values of GOP Ijarah Sukuks and other Ijarah Sukuks are derived using the PKISRV rates announced by the Financial Market Association (FMA) through Reuters. These rates denote an average of quotes received from eight different pre-defined/approved dealers/brokers. The valuation has been determined by interpolating the mid rates announced by the State Bank of Pakistan.

  - **Operating Property & Equipment (Land and Building)**  
    Land and buildings are revalued every three years using professional valuers on the panel of Pakistan Bankers Association. The valuation is based on their assessment of market value of the properties.
