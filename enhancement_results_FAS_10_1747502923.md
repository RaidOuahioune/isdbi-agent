# Standards Enhancement Results - FAS 10

## Trigger Scenario

A financial institution wants to structure an Istisna'a contract for the development 
                              of a large-scale AI software platform. The current wording of FAS 10 on 'well-defined 
                              subject matter' and 'determination of cost' is causing uncertainty for intangible assets 
                              like software development.

## Initial Analysis



## Key Findings

- Based on the analysis provided, the key areas needing enhancement in AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard No. (10) on Istisna’a and Parallel Istisna’a for better application to intangible assets like complex software development are:
- 1.  **Specification Guidance:** Providing specific guidance or alternative criteria for specifying intangible assets/services under Section 4/1/1 (Al-Masnoo' specification).

## Enhancement Proposal





## Expert Discussion

### Round 1

#### Shariah Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 are a necessary and welcome step towards making the standard applicable to modern asset classes, particularly intangible assets like software. From a Shariah perspective, the core challenge in applying Istisna'a to intangibles is ensuring the removal of *Gharar* (uncertainty or ambiguity) regarding the subject matter (*Al-Masnoo'*), its specifications, and its delivery. The current standard's language and examples are heavily weighted towards tangible goods, which makes its application to complex, intangible outcomes like software development difficult and potentially prone to Shariah non-compliance due to lack of clarity.

Proposal 1 directly addresses the specification requirement (4/1/1). By explicitly including intangible assets in examples and providing alternative criteria for quality (functional/non-functional requirements, performance metrics, acceptance criteria) and quantity (features, capacity, deliverables), it provides a framework for defining the intangible *Al-Masnoo'* with sufficient detail to mitigate *Gharar*. This aligns with the fundamental Shariah principle that the subject matter of a contract must be known and specified to avoid disputes. The acknowledgment that specification for novel technologies might involve refinement during development is noted, but requires careful handling to avoid excessive uncertainty (see Concerns).

Proposal 2, which suggests a new section for application rules for intangible subject matter, is crucial. It recognizes that while the principles of Istisna'a apply, their practical implementation for intangibles differs from tangibles. Defining deliverables, acceptance procedures, and delivery mechanisms tailored to software development (e.g., testing protocols, deployment, access rights) provides essential guidance for operationalizing the contract in a Shariah-compliant manner. This clarifies how the key contractual events (completion, acceptance, delivery) occur for intangibles, which is vital for contract validity and fulfilling the obligations of both *Al-Sani'* and *Al-Mustasni'*. The requirement for the intangible asset itself to be Shariah-compliant is fundamental and correctly included.

Proposal 3 addresses the accounting treatment of R&D costs. The Shariah basis for Istisna'a is a contract for manufacturing or constructing a specified asset. The costs incurred by *Al-Sani'* are his responsibility until delivery and acceptance of the conforming *Al-Masnoo'*. The original exclusion of *all* R&D costs seems based on R&D being general overhead. However, for bespoke software or novel technology developed specifically for a particular Istisna'a contract, certain R&D activities are an integral part of the *production* process of that unique asset. Including only *specifically and directly attributable* R&D costs essential for creating the unique *Al-Masnoo'* aligns better with the economic reality of such projects and does not violate any Shariah principles regarding the nature of Istisna'a costs, as these are costs of production borne by *Al-Sani'*. This change primarily impacts financial reporting accuracy (especially for percentage-of-completion), not the underlying Shariah validity of the contract itself, provided the costs are genuinely specific and necessary for *this* *Masnoo'*.

Proposal 4 provides guidance on measuring progress for intangible assets under the percentage-of-completion method. While primarily an accounting matter, the ability to reliably measure progress is predicated on the underlying contractual clarity regarding deliverables and milestones (as addressed in Proposals 1 and 2). The suggested methods (cost-to-cost, efforts-expended, output/milestones) are standard and appropriate for intangible development projects. They provide objective bases for determining the stage of completion, which allows for the timely and accurate recognition of revenue and profit in accordance with the preferred accounting method in FAS 10, without conflicting with Shariah principles, as long as the basis for measurement is clear and verifiable, linked back to the specified *Al-Masnoo'*.

The retrieved excerpts from FAS 10 regarding refusal to receive (3/2/4), non-conformity (3/2/3), and acceptance (3/2/1) highlight the importance of acceptance procedures and conformity to specifications. The proposed enhancements for intangibles (Proposals 1 & 2 regarding specification, acceptance criteria, and procedures) directly support the application of these existing rules to intangible assets, ensuring that mechanisms are in place to determine if the *Al-Masnoo'* conforms and whether acceptance should occur, which is critical from a Shariah perspective for the completion of the contract and transfer of risk/ownership. The excerpts also touch upon loss recognition and cost accounting, which are indirectly supported by the clarification on R&D costs and progress measurement (Proposals 3 & 4) by aiming for more accurate financial reporting of the Istisna'a lifecycle for intangibles.

Overall, these proposals enhance the applicability of FAS 10 to contemporary asset types while remaining consistent with the underlying Shariah principles of Istisna'a by focusing on clarifying specification, delivery, and acceptance for intangibles and ensuring cost reporting reflects the reality of developing such assets.

**Concerns:**

-  **Potential for *Gharar* in Novel Technology Specification:** While Proposal 1 attempts to specify quality for novel technologies (like AI) by referencing intended capabilities and performance targets, the phrase "acknowledging that some aspects of performance may be refined during development based on testing and training data" could introduce significant *Gharar* if not carefully managed within the contract. Shariah requires the *Al-Masnoo'* to be known at the time of contract. While some minor details can be refined, fundamental performance characteristics or core capabilities being subject to significant change based on data or testing could render the subject matter uncertain.
-  **Alignment of Intangible "Delivery" with Fiqhi *Qabd*:** Proposal 2 defines delivery for intangibles in practical terms (deployment, access rights). While this is operationally sound, it's crucial that this definition aligns with the Shariah concept of *Qabd* (possession/control) for intangible assets or rights, as this is a point of scholarly discussion. The accounting standard relies on the underlying Shariah contract being valid, and the timing/nature of *Qabd* is relevant to risk transfer and completion in Fiqh.

**Recommendations:**

-  Regarding the potential *Gharar* in novel technology specification (Concern 1), recommend adding explicit guidance in Proposal 1 or 2 requiring the contract to clearly define: (a) minimum acceptable performance thresholds and core capabilities that *must* be achieved; (b) the specific process and limits for refinement, perhaps through predefined iterative cycles with clear acceptance gates for each iteration; and (c) mechanisms for handling situations where the intended performance targets cannot be met within the agreed scope and price, potentially referencing clear escalation or termination clauses based on predefined failure points. This ensures that even with novelty, the fundamental subject matter remains sufficiently defined to avoid excessive *Gharar*.
-  Regarding the definition of 'delivery' and *Qabd* (Concern 2), recommend adding a note to Proposal 2 stating that the defined methods of delivery for intangible assets are considered, for the purpose of this accounting standard, to represent the effective transfer of control and usability by Al-Mustasni', and that their alignment with the Shariah concept of *Qabd* for intangibles should be confirmed with relevant AAOIFI Shariah Standards or scholarly consensus. This highlights the link between the accounting treatment and the underlying Fiqhi validity.

#### Finance Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 are timely and necessary to address the increasing prevalence of Istisna'a contracts involving intangible assets, such as software development. From a financial accounting and reporting perspective, the proposals significantly improve the standard's applicability and the reliability of financial information for such contracts.

Proposal 1 enhances the specification requirements (Section 4/1/1) by explicitly including intangible assets and providing relevant criteria for defining Quality and Quantity. This is fundamental from an accounting perspective because clear contract terms are essential for reliable recognition and measurement. By providing specific examples and criteria relevant to software (functional/non-functional requirements, performance metrics, features, capacity), the proposal helps ensure that the subject matter of the Istisna'a contract is sufficiently defined to remove *Gharar*, which is a prerequisite for contract validity and subsequent accounting treatment under FAS 10. This clarity supports the ability to estimate costs, measure progress, and ultimately recognize revenue and costs accurately.

Proposal 2 introduces crucial application rules for intangible subject matter. This directly impacts recognition, measurement, and derecognition. Defining deliverables, milestones, and acceptance procedures provides the necessary structure for applying the percentage-of-completion method, which is the preferred method under FAS 10. Clear acceptance criteria are vital for determining when performance obligations are met and when the asset is ready for delivery/acceptance. Defining delivery for intangibles (e.g., deployment, access rights) clarifies the point at which the Sani' derecognizes the Istisna'a work-in-progress asset and recognizes the related receivable or cash, and when the Mustasni' recognizes the acquired intangible asset. This proposal bridges the gap between the standard's principles (designed primarily for tangible construction) and the practicalities of intangible asset development.

Proposal 3 addresses the inclusion of integral R&D costs (Section 2/1(a)). The original blanket exclusion of R&D costs is inconsistent with the nature of many custom intangible development projects where R&D is not general but specific and essential to creating the contracted asset. From an accounting perspective, including R&D costs that are specifically and directly attributable to the unique Al-Masnoo' ensures that the total cost of the contract is measured more comprehensively and accurately reflects the resources consumed. This improves the matching of costs and revenues, particularly under the percentage-of-completion method where cost incurred is often a basis for measuring progress. This change enhances the reliability of the reported Istisna'a costs and the resulting profit recognition. It aligns with the principle of capitalizing costs necessary to bring an asset to its intended use, adapted for a contract manufacturing context.

Proposal 4 provides much-needed guidance on measuring progress (percentage of completion) for intangible assets (Section 2/3/1/1). The current standard's preference for the percentage-of-completion method is challenging to apply to intangibles without specific guidance. Suggesting methods like cost-to-cost, efforts-expended, and output methods (milestones, deliverables) provides practical tools for preparers. These methods are widely recognized in accounting for long-term contracts and can be adapted for intangible development. This guidance enables institutions to apply the preferred method more reliably and objectively, leading to more accurate and timely recognition of revenue, costs, and profit, and a more faithful representation of the Istisna'a work-in-progress asset on the balance sheet. This enhances the relevance and comparability of financial statements for institutions engaged in such contracts.

Overall, the proposals collectively enhance the clarity, applicability, and accounting quality of FAS 10 for Istisna'a contracts involving intangible assets, making the standard more relevant to contemporary Islamic finance activities. They support better recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure by providing specific guidance tailored to the nature of intangibles while remaining consistent with the core principles of FAS 10 and the AAOIFI conceptual framework.

**Concerns:**

-  **Subjectivity in R&D Cost Attributability:** While Proposal 3 clarifies that *general* R&D is excluded and *specifically attributable* R&D is included, the practical distinction between these two categories can be subjective. This might lead to inconsistencies in application across different institutions or contracts, potentially impacting the comparability and reliability of reported Istisna'a costs and profits.
-  **Reliability and Objectivity of Progress Measurement:** Proposal 4 offers valid methods for measuring progress on intangibles, but methods like "efforts-expended" or certain "output" metrics (e.g., "completed features") can still be difficult to measure objectively and verify, especially in complex or iterative development processes. The reliability of the percentage-of-completion calculation hinges entirely on the chosen measurement method being consistently and objectively applied.

**Recommendations:**

-  To address the subjectivity in R&D cost classification (Concern 1), include illustrative examples in an appendix or implementation guidance. These examples should demonstrate scenarios that clearly distinguish between general R&D (expensed) and R&D directly and specifically required for the unique Al-Masnoo' under the contract (capitalized as Istisna'a cost).
-  To enhance the reliability of progress measurement (Concern 2), add emphasis in Proposal 4 that the chosen method for measuring percentage of completion must be objectively verifiable and consistently applied throughout the contract duration. Suggest that institutions document their chosen method and the basis for its application, and that this documentation should be subject to audit review.

#### Standards Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposed enhancements collectively address a critical gap in AAOIFI FAS 10: its applicability to contracts involving intangible assets, particularly software and digital services, which are increasingly common in modern finance. The original standard's language and examples are heavily geared towards tangible goods, leading to significant ambiguity and difficulty in applying its principles, especially regarding contract specification, cost recognition, and progress measurement.

Proposal 1 directly tackles the core requirement of specifying *Al-Masnoo'* (4/1/1) by explicitly including intangible assets in examples and providing alternative, relevant criteria for defining Quality and Quantity. This is crucial for mitigating *Gharar* (uncertainty) in software development contracts, where quality is defined by functional and non-functional requirements and quantity by features, capacity, etc., rather than physical dimensions. The proposed text is clear, logical, and aligns with standard practices in technology contracts.

Proposal 2 proposes a new section to provide overarching application rules for intangible subject matter. This is highly necessary as the development lifecycle, delivery, and acceptance processes for intangibles differ significantly from tangible goods. Defining deliverables, acceptance procedures (like testing protocols), and the point of delivery (e.g., deployment, access transfer) for intangibles is essential for operationalizing the Istisna'a framework in this context. This proposal provides a solid framework consistent with the need for clarity and certainty in the contract.

Proposal 3 addresses the problematic exclusion of all R&D costs from Istisna'a costs (2/1(a)). For novel software or AI development, R&D is often an integral and necessary part of creating the *specific Al-Masnoo'* contracted for. Excluding such directly attributable R&D costs distorts the true cost of production and impacts revenue/profit recognition, especially under the percentage-of-completion method. The proposed distinction between general R&D and specific, directly attributable R&D is consistent with cost accounting principles for bespoke projects and is vital for accurate financial reporting under FAS 10.

Proposal 4 provides much-needed guidance on applying the percentage-of-completion method (2/3/1/1) to intangible assets. This method is preferred under FAS 10, but measuring progress for software requires specific techniques. Listing relevant methods like cost-to-cost, efforts-expended, and output methods (milestones, deliverables) provides practical options for institutions, enabling them to apply the preferred method reliably and objectively, ensuring timely and accurate revenue and profit recognition.

Overall, the proposals demonstrate a strong understanding of the challenges in applying FAS 10 to intangibles and offer well-considered solutions that enhance the standard's clarity, consistency with underlying Shariah principles (reducing *Gharar*, accurate cost/revenue matching), and practical applicability in the modern digital economy. They do not conflict with the provided excerpts, which deal with the *results* of the Istisna'a process (receipt, non-conformity, disclosure) rather than the specifics of applying the process to intangibles.

**Concerns:**

-  **Placement and Prominence of Application Rules (Proposal 2):** Placing the essential application rules for intangible subject matter (Proposal 2) potentially within an Appendix (C) might reduce their prominence and perceived importance. These are fundamental rules for applying the standard to a significant class of assets and should ideally be integrated into the main body of the standard, perhaps as a new sub-section within Section 4 or a dedicated section following it.
-  **Practical Application of Cost Attributability and Progress Measurement:** While the proposed methods for R&D cost inclusion (Proposal 3) and progress measurement (Proposal 4) are sound in principle, their practical application in complex, novel technology projects can still be challenging. Determining what is "specifically and directly attributable" R&D or ensuring the reliability of "efforts-expended" or "output" metrics for unique software requires robust internal processes and judgment. Without further illustrative guidance, there remains potential for inconsistency in application across institutions.

**Recommendations:**

-  **Relocate Proposal 2 Guidance:** Integrate the guidance proposed in Proposal 2 into the main body of the standard, preferably as a new sub-section within Section 4 or a dedicated section immediately following Section 4, to ensure its prominence and clear link to the conditions for the validity of Istisna'a.
-  **Provide Implementation Guidance/Examples:** Consider developing supplementary implementation guidance or including brief examples (potentially in an appendix) for Proposal 3 and Proposal 4. This guidance could illustrate the distinction between general and specific R&D in technology contexts and provide examples of how output-based progress metrics (milestones, deliverables) can be structured for software development, emphasizing the importance of verifiability and reliability.

### Round 2

#### Shariah Expert

**Analysis:**

From a Shariah perspective, the proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 are a positive and necessary development to extend the applicability of the Istisna'a contract framework to modern intangible assets like software and digital platforms. The core challenge in applying Istisna'a to such assets lies in fulfilling the Shariah requirement to remove *Gharar* (uncertainty) regarding the subject matter (*Al-Masnoo’*), its attributes, and its delivery. The current standard's emphasis on tangible goods makes this difficult for intangibles.

Proposal 1 directly addresses the specification requirement (Section 4/1/1). The original text's criteria (Kind, Type, Quality, Quantity) are clearly designed for tangible items. The proposed adaptation provides relevant alternative criteria for intangibles, focusing on functionality, performance, scope, and intended use, defined through specifications, metrics, use cases, etc. This approach is essential for defining an intangible *Al-Masnoo’* with sufficient clarity to mitigate *Gharar*, aligning with the fundamental Shariah principle that the subject matter of a contract must be known. As noted in the previous discussion, this provides a necessary framework. The acknowledgement of potential specification evolution for complex/novel assets is noted, but requires careful handling to avoid introducing excessive uncertainty that could invalidate the contract from a Shariah perspective.

Proposal 2, which suggests a new section for application rules for intangible subject matter, builds upon the basis provided in Footnote 7 of Appendix C (retrieved excerpt Document 3), which explicitly states that Al-Masnoo' may be a commodity, service, or both. This proposal acknowledges that while Istisna'a principles apply, their practical implementation for intangibles differs. Defining "delivery" for intangibles (e.g., deployment, access, acceptance) is crucial for determining when the *Sani'* has fulfilled their obligation and when *Al-Mustasni'* gains control or benefit, which is relevant to the concept of *Qabd* (possession/control) in Fiqh, although Istisna'a has specific rules regarding *Qabd* upon completion and conformity. Explicitly defining acceptance criteria and processes (linking back to the enhanced specifications in Proposal 1) is vital, as acceptance confirms conformity to specifications, a key requirement for fulfilling the contract and validating the *Sani*'s entitlement to payment, as implied by the rules on non-conformity and acceptance in the retrieved excerpt (Document 1). Clarifying intellectual property rights is also necessary for modern intangible assets and must be handled in accordance with Shariah principles regarding rights and benefits transfer. This proposal provides much-needed clarity for the operationalization of intangible Istisna'a contracts in a Shariah-compliant manner.

Proposal 3 addresses the treatment of R&D costs (Section 2/1(a)). The original blanket exclusion of R&D costs is problematic for bespoke intangible development where R&D is not general overhead but an integral part of creating the specific, contracted *Al-Masnoo’*. From a Shariah perspective, the costs incurred by the *Sani'* to produce the specified asset are his responsibility until delivery and acceptance. Including R&D costs that are *directly and necessarily incurred* for the specific *Al-Masnoo’* aligns with the economic reality of such projects and does not violate any Shariah principle regarding the nature of Istisna'a costs. It reflects the actual cost of production borne by the *Sani'*. As highlighted in the previous discussion, this primarily impacts financial reporting accuracy, particularly for percentage-of-completion, without undermining the Shariah validity of the contract itself.

Proposal 4 provides guidance on measuring progress for intangible assets under the percentage-of-completion method (Section 2/3/1/1). While primarily an accounting matter, the ability to reliably measure progress is predicated on the underlying contractual clarity provided by Proposals 1 and 2 regarding deliverables and milestones. The suggested methods (milestones, outputs, inputs) are appropriate for intangible development and, if applied based on clearly defined and verifiable criteria linked to the specified *Al-Masnoo’*, allow for objective determination of the stage of completion. This supports the application of the preferred accounting method in FAS 10 in a manner consistent with the need for clarity and certainty in Shariah-compliant transactions.

The retrieved excerpts collectively support the need for these enhancements. Document 3 confirms the permissibility of intangible subject matter (Footnote 7) and discusses the legitimacy of Istisna'a based on Istihsan, need, and Ijma', principles that justify adapting the standard to modern needs as long as core Shariah requirements are met. Document 1 highlights the importance of specification conformity and acceptance, rules that require the enhanced guidance in Proposals 1 and 2 to be practically applicable to intangibles. Document 2 compares Istisna'a to Salam, noting its binding nature and flexibility in price payment, characteristics unaffected by the proposed enhancements for intangibles.

Overall, these proposals enhance the clarity and practical applicability of FAS 10 for contemporary Istisna'a structures involving intangible assets, addressing key challenges related to *Gharar* by providing mechanisms for clear specification, delivery, and acceptance, while ensuring cost reporting reflects the reality of developing such assets.

**Concerns:**

-  **Potential for Excessive *Gharar* in Specification Refinement for Novel Assets:** While Proposal 1 aims to clarify specification for intangibles, the allowance for specifications to "evolve during the contract execution, provided that the core objective and scope... are clearly defined at inception" could still introduce significant *Gharar* for truly novel or R&D-heavy intangible assets (like advanced AI platforms). Shariah requires the subject matter (*Al-Masnoo’*) to be known and specified at the time of contracting to avoid disputes. If the core objective and scope are too broad, or the "evolution" is not tightly controlled within predefined parameters (e.g., clear limits on changes, specific iterative acceptance gates), the uncertainty regarding the final delivered asset could be excessive, potentially affecting the Shariah validity of the contract. This concern was raised by the Shariah expert in the previous discussion.
-  **Clarity on the Relationship between Defined "Delivery" and Fiqhi *Qabd*:** Proposal 2 defines "delivery" for intangible assets in practical terms relevant to accounting (deployment, access, acceptance). While operationally necessary, it is crucial that this definition aligns with or is understood in the context of the Shariah concept of *Qabd* (possession or control) for intangible assets or rights. The timing and nature of *Qabd* can have implications for risk transfer and the point at which the *Sani'* is considered to have fulfilled their obligation from a Fiqhi perspective, even if Istisna'a has unique rules regarding *Qabd* (e.g., generally upon completion and conformity). Explicitly addressing this link would strengthen the Shariah basis for the accounting treatment. This concern was also raised by the Shariah expert in the previous discussion.

**Recommendations:**

-  To address the *Gharar* concern related to specification evolution for novel assets (Concern 1), add further clarification in Proposal 1 or the proposed new section in Proposal 2 requiring the contract to include specific mechanisms that limit and manage specification changes. This could involve: (a) defining clear, non-negotiable minimum core functionalities and performance thresholds that *must* be met; (b) establishing a predefined, limited change order process with clear cost and timeline implications; and (c) specifying objective criteria for acceptance at different stages or milestones, particularly for iterative development, to ensure progress towards a known outcome. This strengthens the certainty regarding the subject matter throughout the contract lifecycle.
-  To address the clarity on "delivery" and *Qabd* (Concern 2), add a note or a sentence in the proposed new section (Proposal 2) clarifying that the methods of delivery defined for intangible assets are considered, for the purpose of this accounting standard, as the practical means by which *Al-Mustasni'* obtains control and usability of the asset, and that this aligns with the effective transfer of benefit/control relevant to the completion of the *Sani*'s obligation under the Istisna'a contract in accordance with relevant Shariah principles or AAOIFI Shariah Standards rulings on *Qabd* for intangibles. This reinforces the connection between the accounting concept and the underlying Fiqhi reality.

#### Finance Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 represent a critical and necessary evolution of the standard to adequately address Istisna'a contracts involving intangible assets, such as software development, digital platforms, and specific services. From a financial accounting and reporting perspective, the current standard's framework, primarily designed for tangible construction or manufacturing, presents significant challenges in recognition, measurement, and presentation when applied to intangibles. These proposals directly tackle these issues, aiming to improve the relevance, reliability, and comparability of financial reporting for such contracts.

Proposal 1, focusing on enhanced specification guidance (Section 4/1/1), is fundamental. Clear and detailed specifications of Al-Masnoo' are a prerequisite for a valid Istisna'a contract under Shari'a and are equally crucial for reliable accounting. For intangible assets, traditional physical attributes are irrelevant. The proposed alternative criteria – focusing on functionality, performance, scope, and use cases – provide a basis for defining the intangible asset with sufficient clarity to enable reliable estimation of costs and progress towards completion. This supports the application of measurement principles under FAS 10 and is essential for mitigating accounting risk arising from contract ambiguity.

Proposal 2, suggesting a new section for application rules for intangible subject matter, is vital for operationalizing the accounting framework. Defining practical aspects like delivery and acceptance criteria for intangibles (e.g., successful deployment, meeting performance benchmarks, formal acceptance based on specifications) directly impacts the timing of revenue and cost recognition, particularly under the percentage-of-completion method (Section 2/3/1/1). These definitions clarify when performance obligations are met, when the Istisna'a work-in-progress (WIP) asset can be derecognized, and when a receivable is appropriately recognized (as illustrated by the structure in Document 1 and 2). Without this clarity, applying existing rules regarding acceptance (Section 3/2/1), non-conformity (Section 3/2/3), and refusal (Section 3/2/4) to intangibles would be highly subjective.

Proposal 3, addressing the inclusion of integral R&D costs (Section 2/1(a)), corrects a significant limitation of the current standard when applied to novel intangible asset development. The blanket exclusion of all R&D costs is suitable for general R&D overhead, but not for costs directly and necessarily incurred to create the *specific* Al-Masnoo' under contract. Including such specific R&D costs as direct contract costs aligns the accounting treatment with the economic reality of developing unique intangible assets. This improves the accuracy of the Istisna'a cost measurement, leading to better matching of costs and revenues and more reliable profit recognition, especially under the percentage-of-completion method where costs incurred are often a basis for measuring progress. It directly impacts the calculation of the Istisna'a work-in-progress balance (as seen in Document 3's examples of WIP valuation).

Proposal 4 provides much-needed guidance on measuring progress for intangibles under the percentage-of-completion method (Section 2/3/1/1). The current standard's preference for this method is difficult to apply to software without specific metrics. Suggesting methods like milestones, output measures (features, test cases), and input measures (cost-to-cost, efforts-expended) provides practical tools. While the cost-to-cost method is implicitly supported by the cost structure shown in Document 1 and 2 (Istisna'a costs, billings, receivables, payables), the other methods are more output-oriented and potentially more reflective of value creation in intangible development. Reliable measurement of progress is paramount for the percentage-of-completion method's validity, impacting the timing and amount of profit recognized and the valuation of the WIP asset. The proposal correctly emphasizes the need for reliability and accuracy in estimation.

Collectively, these proposals enhance the applicability of FAS 10 to a growing area of Islamic finance. They address key accounting challenges related to defining the subject matter, determining completion and delivery, measuring costs, and calculating progress for intangible assets. This leads to more relevant and reliable financial information, improving the basis for financial analysis (e.g., profitability ratios, asset composition) and ensuring consistency with the core principles of FAS 10 and the broader AAOIFI conceptual framework regarding accrual accounting and faithful representation. The proposals are consistent with the existing standard's structure and accounting principles, merely adapting them for a new asset class.

**Concerns:**

-  **Subjectivity and Verifiability of Intangible Progress Measurement:** While Proposal 4 provides valid methods for measuring progress for intangibles (milestones, outputs, inputs), the practical application, especially for complex or novel projects, can still involve significant subjectivity. Measuring "efforts expended" or defining and verifying the completion of specific "features" or "test cases" might lack the objectivity and verifiability typically associated with physical completion metrics. This could lead to inconsistencies in applying the percentage-of-completion method across different entities or contracts, potentially impacting the comparability and reliability of reported revenue, costs, and WIP.
-  **Practical Distinction of Integral R&D Costs:** Proposal 3 allows for the inclusion of R&D costs "directly and necessarily incurred" for the specific Al-Masnoo', distinguishing them from general R&D. While conceptually sound, drawing a clear, auditable line between R&D activities that are integral to creating *this specific* contracted intangible asset versus R&D that contributes more broadly to the entity's technological capabilities or future products can be challenging in practice. This subjectivity could impact the measurement of Istisna'a costs and potentially be a source of inconsistency and manipulation.

**Recommendations:**

-  To address the subjectivity in both R&D cost classification (Concern 2) and the practical application of progress measurement methods for intangibles (Concern 1), develop and include detailed implementation guidance or illustrative examples within an appendix to FAS 10. These examples should provide concrete scenarios demonstrating: (a) how to distinguish between general R&D and directly attributable R&D in technology development contexts; and (b) how specific progress measurement methods (e.g., milestone achievement, output metrics) can be structured and verified for software or digital platform development, emphasizing the documentation required to support the reliability of the chosen method.
-  Regarding the reliability of progress measurement (Concern 1), add explicit text in Section 2/3/1/1 or the proposed guidance emphasizing that the chosen method for measuring percentage of completion for intangible assets must not only be appropriate for the contract nature but also be objectively verifiable and consistently applied. Require entities to document the basis for their chosen method and the calculation of progress, and state that this documentation should be subject to audit procedures to enhance reliability and reduce the risk of misstatement.

#### Standards Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 represent a crucial and necessary update to address the standard's applicability to contemporary asset classes, particularly intangible assets like software, digital platforms, and services. The original standard, as evidenced by the retrieved excerpts focusing on receipt, refusal, non-conformity, and cost components (which are described in terms more readily applicable to tangible goods), lacks specific guidance for the unique characteristics of intangibles. This creates significant ambiguity in applying key requirements such as specification (4/1/1), cost inclusion (2/1(a)), and progress measurement (2/3/1/1).

Proposal 1 directly tackles the specification issue by providing alternative criteria for intangible assets, focusing on functional, performance, and scope definition. This is critical for clarity and mitigating *Gharar* in technology contracts, aligning the standard with the practical realities of defining such assets. The proposed text for 4/1/1 is clear and provides relevant examples.

Proposal 2, suggesting a new section for application rules for intangibles, is essential for operationalizing Istisna'a for this asset class. Defining delivery, acceptance criteria, intellectual property, and transfer of benefit for intangibles provides the necessary framework for consistent application of the standard's recognition and measurement principles. This addresses a major gap highlighted by the explicit mention of services/commodities in Footnote 7 (Appendix C) without corresponding detailed rules in the main standard.

Proposal 3 clarifies the inclusion of R&D costs. The current blanket exclusion in 2/1(a) is impractical for bespoke technology development where R&D is integral to creating the specific contracted asset. The proposed distinction between general R&D and specific, directly attributable R&D is consistent with cost accounting principles for bespoke projects and allows for more accurate cost measurement and profit recognition under FAS 10.

Proposal 4 provides much-needed guidance on measuring percentage of completion for intangibles. The proposed methods (milestones, output, input) are relevant and standard approaches for software development projects. This guidance enables institutions to apply the preferred percentage-of-completion method (2/3/1/1) more reliably to intangible contracts, improving the accuracy and timeliness of financial reporting.

Collectively, these proposals enhance the clarity, consistency, and practical applicability of FAS 10 for a growing segment of Islamic finance activities. They provide a logical extension of the standard's principles to intangible assets, addressing the unique challenges while remaining consistent with the underlying contractual nature of Istisna'a and the need for clear specification and measurement to avoid *Gharar*. The retrieved excerpts on non-conformity and refusal (3/2/3, 3/2/4) underscore the importance of clear specifications and acceptance procedures, which the proposals directly support for intangibles.

**Concerns:**

-  **Placement and Prominence of Application Rules (Proposal 2):** Placing the crucial application rules for intangible assets (defining delivery, acceptance, IP, etc.) potentially within an Appendix (as suggested) rather than integrating them into the main body of the standard diminishes their prominence and importance. These rules are fundamental to understanding how the entire standard applies to a significant class of assets and should be readily accessible and clearly linked to the core requirements like specification and completion. This affects the logical flow and ease of use of the standard.
-  **Potential for Subjectivity and Inconsistency:** While the proposed changes in Proposal 3 (R&D cost attribution) and Proposal 4 (progress measurement methods) provide necessary flexibility, they also introduce areas requiring significant judgment. The distinction between general R&D and specific, directly attributable R&D can be subjective. Similarly, the reliability and objectivity of methods like "efforts-expended" or certain "output" metrics for complex, novel intangibles can be challenging to ensure consistently across different institutions or projects. This could lead to variations in reported costs and profits, impacting comparability and reliability of financial statements without further clarifying guidance or examples.

**Recommendations:**

-  **Relocate Intangible Application Rules:** Integrate the guidance proposed in Proposal 2 into the main body of FAS 10. Consider placing it as a new section (e.g., Section 5: Specific Considerations for Intangible Assets) immediately following the core requirements (Sections 1-4), or as a dedicated sub-section within Section 4 if deemed more appropriate, to ensure its prominence and structural clarity.
-  **Develop Implementation Guidance or Examples:** To mitigate the subjectivity concerns in Proposals 3 and 4, develop supplementary implementation guidance or include illustrative examples within an appendix. This guidance should provide practical scenarios demonstrating the distinction between general and specific R&D in technology contexts and illustrate how reliable and verifiable methods for measuring progress (especially output-based) can be applied to intangible asset development, emphasizing the documentation and consistency requirements.

**Evaluation of Proposed Enhancements:**

**Proposal 1: Enhanced Specification Guidance for Intangible Subject Matter (Al-Masnoo')**

*   **Proposed Change:** Expand examples and criteria in 4/1/1 to explicitly include intangible assets/services and provide specific methods (functional/non-functional requirements, metrics, acceptance criteria, scope, features, capacity) for defining their Quality and Quantity.
*   **Issue Addressed:** Uncertainty (Gharar) in specifying intangible Al-Masnoo'.

*   **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**
    *   **Principle:** Prohibition of Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty). A fundamental requirement for contract validity is clarity on the subject matter. The original text's focus on tangible goods creates ambiguity when applying it to intangibles, potentially leading to Gharar regarding what is being manufactured/delivered.
    *   **Reasoning:** The proposal directly addresses this by providing concrete, industry-standard methods for defining intangible assets (like software). Specifying functional/non-functional requirements, performance metrics, acceptance criteria, scope, features, etc., are the established ways to define intangible deliverables in modern contracts. By explicitly incorporating these, the standard provides practical guidance to reduce Gharar in Istisna'a contracts for intangibles. This is fully compliant with the Shariah principle of mitigating Gharar and reinforces the Istisna'a specific principle of Specification of Subject Matter. It does not introduce Riba, Maysir, or conflict with other principles.
    *   **Assessment:** Compliant.

*   **Consistency Check:**
    *   **Internal Consistency (FAS 10):** The proposal enhances the existing requirement for specifying Al-Masnoo' (4/1/1) by making it applicable to a type of asset already acknowledged as permissible subject matter (Footnote 7 allows services). It doesn't contradict the core requirement but provides necessary detail for its application in a modern context. Consistent.
    *   **Related Standards Consistency:** AAOIFI standards generally acknowledge the existence and potential involvement of intangible assets in Islamic finance transactions (e.g., FAS 4 mentions intangible assets as potential Musharaka capital). Extending the applicability of Istisna'a specification rules to intangibles aligns with the broader recognition of such assets within Islamic finance. Consistent.

*   **Practical Implementation Assessment:**
    *   **Reasoning:** The methods proposed for specifying intangible assets (functional/non-functional requirements, milestones, features, etc.) are standard practices in technology development and service contracts globally. Financial institutions engaging in such financing activities would readily understand and apply these criteria. Highly practical.

*   **Preliminary Conclusion (Proposal 1):** This proposal is sound, necessary for modern applications of Istisna'a, enhances Shariah compliance by mitigating Gharar for intangibles, maintains consistency, and is practical.

**Proposal 2: Detailed Application Rules for Intangible Subject Matter (Footnote 7)**

*   **Proposed Change:** Expand Footnote 7 to emphasize the need for clear definition of specifications, completion, delivery, and acceptance criteria when Al-Masnoo' is primarily intangible/service, suggesting measurable milestones/deliverables.
*   **Issue Addressed:** Lack of specific guidance for intangibles despite Footnote 7 permitting services, leading to potential Gharar.

*   **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**
    *   **Principle:** Prohibition of Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty). Clarity on *what* is delivered and *when/how* it is accepted is crucial to prevent disputes and uncertainty. For intangible assets/services, delivery and acceptance mechanisms differ significantly from tangible goods.
    *   **Reasoning:** This proposal reinforces the critical need to define contract terms (specifications, completion, delivery, acceptance) in a manner appropriate for intangibles. By explicitly stating this requirement and suggesting measurable milestones, it directly targets the reduction of Gharar inherent in non-physical deliverables. This strengthens the Shariah compliance of Istisna'a for intangibles by ensuring clarity on key contractual elements.
    *   **Assessment:** Compliant.

*   **Consistency Check:**
    *   **Internal Consistency (FAS 10):** This proposal builds upon the existing permission in Footnote 7 and reinforces the specification requirements in 4/1/1 (as modified by Proposal 1). It aligns with the general principles of Istisna'a validity which require clarity on the subject matter and delivery. Consistent.
    *   **Related Standards Consistency:** No conflict identified.

*   **Practical Implementation Assessment:**
    *   **Reasoning:** Defining delivery and acceptance mechanisms (e.g., successful installation, user acceptance testing, meeting performance benchmarks) and breaking down projects into measurable milestones are standard practices in projects involving intangible assets like software. This guidance is practical and implementable.

*   **Preliminary Conclusion (Proposal 2):** This proposal effectively reinforces Shariah principles by addressing Gharar in intangible contracts and provides practical guidance within the existing standard structure.

**Proposal 3: Clarification of R&D Cost Inclusion for Integral Knowledge Work**

*   **Proposed Change:** Modify 2/1(a) to allow R&D costs to be included in Istisna'a contract costs if they are an integral and inseparable part of designing/creating the *specific* Al-Masnoo', particularly for novel/intangible assets, while still excluding general G&A and selling expenses.
*   **Issue Addressed:** Original blanket exclusion of R&D costs is inappropriate when R&D is integral to producing the specific contracted intangible asset.

*   **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**
    *   **Principle:** Transparency and Fairness, particularly in financial reporting. While accounting treatment is not a direct Shariah contract validity issue like Riba or Gharar, accurate reporting of project costs is essential for determining profit, which is shared or recognized based on the contract. Misstating costs can lead to misrepresentation of financial performance.
    *   **Reasoning:** The original exclusion likely intended to prevent general R&D (corporate overhead) from being capitalized into specific contract costs. However, for novel or complex intangible assets, the R&D *is* the manufacturing process – the 'making' of Al-Masnoo'. Including costs that are directly and inseparably linked to producing the *specific* contracted item provides a more accurate reflection of the true cost of fulfilling that contract. This aligns with the principle of matching costs and revenues and improves the reliability of financial reporting, which supports transparency. It does not impact the fixed price of the Istisna'a contract itself.
    *   **Assessment:** Compliant (Addresses an accounting principle in a Shariah-compliant manner).

*   **Consistency Check:**
    *   **Internal Consistency (FAS 10):** Modifies 2/1(a). The change clarifies the scope of "Research and development costs" exclusion, distinguishing between general R&D and contract-specific R&D integral to production. This refinement improves the standard's applicability to complex modern contracts without contradicting other cost recognition principles. Consistent.
    *   **Related Standards Consistency:** No conflict identified. Accounting for costs directly attributable to an asset's creation is a standard accounting principle.

*   **Practical Implementation Assessment:**
    *   **Reasoning:** Financial institutions or manufacturers often track costs at a project level. Distinguishing between general R&D and R&D specifically required and performed *for* a particular Istisna'a contract is practical, although it requires robust internal cost accounting systems. The phrasing "integral and inseparable part of designing and creating the specific Al-Masnoo' as defined in the contract" provides a clear criterion for inclusion. Practical, assuming adequate cost tracking systems.

*   **Preliminary Conclusion (Proposal 3):** This proposal is essential for accurate accounting of modern Istisna'a contracts involving novel intangibles and aligns with good financial reporting practices consistent with transparency.

**Proposal 4: Guidance on Progress Measurement for Intangible Assets**

*   **Proposed Change:** Add guidance to 2/3/1/1 and Appendix E suggesting methods for measuring percentage of completion for intangibles (cost-to-cost, milestones, features, time elapsed) and emphasizing reliability and disclosure.
*   **Issue Addressed:** Difficulty in reliably measuring percentage of completion for intangibles using traditional methods, hindering the application of the preferred accounting method.

*   **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**
    *   **Principle:** Transparency and Fairness in financial reporting. The percentage-of-completion method is preferred in FAS 10 (Appendix E) because it provides better matching of revenues/expenses and reflects earning activities over time. This aligns with the goal of presenting a true and fair view of the financial position and performance, which is consistent with Shariah principles of transparency in dealings.
    *   **Reasoning:** Providing practical methods for measuring progress for intangibles allows financial institutions to apply the *preferred* accounting method to a wider range of Istisna'a contracts. This improves the accuracy and relevance of financial reporting over the life of the contract. The emphasis on *reliability* of the measurement method and *disclosure* further enhances transparency. It does not affect the underlying Istisna'a contract's Shariah validity (fixed price, subject matter definition, etc.).
    *   **Assessment:** Compliant (Enhances financial reporting accuracy and transparency).

*   **Consistency Check:**
    *   **Internal Consistency (FAS 10):** This proposal directly supports and clarifies the application of the percentage-of-completion method (2/3/1/1) and its rationale (Appendix E) in a context (intangibles) where the original guidance was insufficient. It maintains the preference for this method while providing the tools to apply it appropriately. Consistent.
    *   **Related Standards Consistency:** No conflict identified. This is an accounting application issue specific to long-term contracts like Istisna'a.

*   **Practical Implementation Assessment:**
    *   **Reasoning:** The suggested methods (cost-to-cost, milestones, features, time elapsed) are recognized project management and accounting techniques for tracking progress on intangible development projects. While applying them reliably requires careful planning and tracking, they are standard industry practices. The requirement for disclosure adds a necessary layer of transparency. Practical.

*   **Preliminary Conclusion (Proposal 4):** This proposal is crucial for enabling the accurate and transparent financial reporting of Istisna'a contracts for intangibles using the standard's preferred method.

**Final Decision:**

Based on the detailed validation checks, all four proposed enhancements are found to be:
1.  **Compliant with Core Shariah Principles:** They either directly mitigate potential Gharar (Proposals 1 & 2) or improve the accuracy and transparency of financial reporting (Proposals 3 & 4), which aligns with broader Islamic financial principles. They do not introduce Riba, Maysir, or violate other prohibitions.
2.  **Consistent with FAS 10:** They build upon and clarify existing sections and principles within the standard, adapting them to the context of intangible assets/services without contradiction.
3.  **Consistent with Related Standards:** They do not conflict with principles found in other relevant AAOIFI standards.
4.  **Practical and Implementable:** The proposed methods and requirements align with standard industry practices for managing and accounting for projects involving intangible assets like software.

The proposed enhancements collectively address a significant gap in FAS 10 regarding the application of Istisna'a to intangible assets, which are increasingly relevant in modern economies. They provide necessary clarity and practical guidance while upholding Shariah principles, particularly the mitigation of Gharar, and improving financial reporting accuracy.

Therefore, the proposed enhancement package is deemed appropriate and necessary for the standard's continued relevance and applicability.

**Decision:** APPROVED

**Detailed Reasoning for Approval:**
The proposed enhancements effectively extend the applicability of AAOIFI FAS 10 to Istisna'a contracts for intangible assets and services, which is crucial given the evolving nature of manufacturing and development projects.
*   Proposals 1 and 2 directly enhance Shariah compliance by providing clear, practical methods for specifying intangible subject matter (Al-Masnoo') and defining key contractual terms (completion, delivery, acceptance). This significantly reduces the Gharar that would otherwise arise from applying rules primarily designed for tangible goods to complex intangible deliverables like software platforms.
*   Proposal 3 clarifies the inclusion of R&D costs, providing a more accurate accounting treatment for contracts where R&D is integral to the production of the specific contracted asset. This improves cost reporting and profit recognition accuracy, aligning with the principles of transparency and fair representation in financial statements.
*   Proposal 4 provides essential guidance for applying the preferred percentage-of-completion accounting method to intangible assets by suggesting appropriate measurement techniques. This ensures that financial reporting for such contracts accurately reflects the stage of completion and the earning activities over time, further enhancing transparency and consistency with the standard's stated objectives for this method.

All proposals are internally consistent with FAS 10 and do not conflict with other AAOIFI standards. The methods suggested are practical and align with industry norms for managing and accounting for technology and service development projects. The enhancements collectively make the standard more robust and applicable to contemporary financing needs while strictly adhering to Shariah requirements.

## Cross-Standard Impact Analysis

## Cross-Standard Impact Analysis

The proposed enhancements to FAS 10 focus on adapting the standard to effectively handle Istisna'a contracts where the subject matter (Al-Masnoo') is an intangible asset or service, such as software or complex services. This involves providing detailed guidance on specification to mitigate *Gharar*, allowing the inclusion of integral R&D costs, and offering methods for measuring progress for profit recognition.

The primary impact of these changes on other AAOIFI standards is not one of direct contradiction, but rather potential synergy and the introduction of principles and methodologies that could be relevant by analogy, particularly for standards dealing with long-term projects, partnerships, or assets that might involve intangible elements or creation/development phases.

1.  **FAS 4 (Musharakah and Mudarabah):** Musharakah contracts involve partners contributing capital (which can include intangible assets) and sharing profits/losses. If a Musharakah venture involves the creation or development of a complex asset or service, especially an intangible one (e.g., developing a new technology platform), the principles introduced in the enhanced FAS 10 become highly relevant.
    *   **Synergy:** The detailed guidance in FAS 10 on specifying intangible assets/services (Proposal 1 & 2) could provide valuable analogous principles for defining and valuing intangible contributions to a Musharakah capital or specifying the output of a Musharakah development project, thereby reducing *Gharar* within the partnership agreement.
    *   **Synergy:** The clarification on including integral R&D costs (Proposal 3) aligns with the economic reality of developing novel assets. This principle could inform how similar direct development costs are treated within a Musharakah venture to accurately determine profitability for profit sharing.
    *   **Synergy:** The guidance on measuring progress for intangible assets (Proposal 4) provides methods (cost-to-cost, milestones, etc.) that could be applied by analogy to long-term Musharakah projects involving the creation of intangibles, enabling more accurate periodic profit recognition where appropriate, consistent with the matching principle.
    *   **Overall:** The enhancements in FAS 10 provide a framework for handling the complexities of creating intangibles, which is a type of activity that could be undertaken within a Musharakah structure. This offers significant synergistic potential for accounting for such ventures under FAS 4.

2.  **FAS 7 (Zakat):** This standard deals with the calculation of Zakat. While the value of assets financed through Istisna'a or derived profits might eventually factor into Zakat calculations for the financial institution or its customers, the specific accounting treatments related to Istisna'a costs, specification, or progress measurement for intangibles have no direct bearing on the principles or calculation methodologies defined in FAS 7. Zakat is based on ownership and value of qualifying assets (Nisab and Hawl), not the specific financing mechanism used for their creation.

3.  **FAS 10 (Istisna'a and Parallel Istisna'a):** These are the standards being enhanced. The proposals are designed to improve and clarify FAS 10 itself, specifically for intangible assets/services. They are intended to resolve existing ambiguities and gaps within the standard.
    *   **Synergy (within FAS 10):** The proposals work together to provide a more comprehensive framework for intangible Istisna'a. Clearer specification (P1, P2) enables better cost estimation (P3 context) and more reliable progress measurement (P4), which in turn supports the preferred percentage-of-completion method.
    *   **No Contradiction (within FAS 10):** The proposals do not contradict existing principles but rather extend and refine them to cover a modern application (intangibles). They maintain the core Istisna'a requirements while providing practical guidance for non-physical subject matter.

4.  **FAS 28 (Murabaha and Other Deferred Payment Sales):** Murabaha is a cost-plus sale of an *existing* or *acquired* asset. It does not involve the manufacturing or creation process that is central to Istisna'a. The principles related to specifying creation requirements, accounting for production costs (like R&D), or measuring progress during manufacturing are not relevant to Murabaha transactions. While Murabaha could theoretically involve the sale of an intangible asset (e.g., software license), the accounting for that sale would follow FAS 28's principles for deferred payment sales, not the Istisna'a creation-based accounting.

5.  **FAS 32 (Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek):** Ijarah deals with leasing assets. The subject matter is the leased asset, which can be tangible or, less commonly in traditional practice, intangible. The accounting focuses on lease income/expense recognition and asset management, not the creation of the asset.
    *   **Low Synergy:** While FAS 32 might involve intangible assets, the FAS 10 enhancements are specific to the *creation* process via Istisna'a. However, the general principles of specifying intangible assets clearly to avoid *Gharar* (Proposal 1 & 2) could serve as useful background principles if intangible assets are the subject of an Ijarah contract, although FAS 32 itself does not provide detailed guidance on *how* to specify leased intangibles. There is no direct impact on Ijarah accounting principles or methodologies.

In summary, the primary cross-standard impact is a positive synergy with FAS 4, providing valuable analogous guidance for Musharakah ventures involving the creation of intangible assets. There is minimal to no direct impact or contradiction with FAS 7, FAS 28, or FAS 32, as the proposed changes are highly specific to the nature and accounting of Istisna'a as a manufacturing/creation contract and its application to intangibles.

## Compatibility Matrix

| Standard ID | Impact Level | Impact Type |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| FAS 4       | Medium       | Synergy     |
| FAS 7       | None         | None        |
| FAS 10      | High         | Synergy     |
| FAS 28      | None         | None        |
| FAS 32      | Low          | Synergy     |

*Note: FAS 10 is included as the standard being enhanced; the impact level reflects the significance of the internal changes and clarifications.*

## Recommendations

1.  **Cross-Reference in FAS 4:** Add a note or cross-reference within FAS 4 (perhaps in sections related to capital contributions involving non-monetary/intangible assets or accounting for project-based Musharakah) directing users to the enhanced FAS 10 for analogous guidance on specifying intangible assets and potentially principles for recognizing costs and measuring progress in creation/development projects.
2.  **Basis for Conclusions in FAS 10:** Explicitly state in the Basis for Conclusions of the enhanced FAS 10 that the detailed guidance for intangible assets is primarily for Istisna'a contracts but may offer useful principles by analogy for other AAOIFI standards (specifically mentioning FAS 4) when dealing with similar issues related to intangible assets or creation/development activities.
3.  **Consistency in Intangible Asset Treatment:** Ensure that the terminology and conceptual approach to defining, specifying, and potentially valuing intangible assets in the enhanced FAS 10 are consistent with any other AAOIFI standards or pronouncements that might address intangible assets in different contexts (e.g., as assets on the balance sheet, if not already covered comprehensively).
4.  **Monitoring for Future Overlap:** Continue to monitor the application of the enhanced FAS 10 and other standards. If, in the future, other contract types (like a more expansive view of assets in Ijarah or Murabaha) increasingly involve complex, created intangibles, consider whether further cross-referencing or explicit guidance is needed in those standards based on the principles established in FAS 10.
