## Evaluation Metrics

For each test case, evaluate the following aspects of the generated product design:

1. **Contract Appropriateness**: Does the recommended Islamic contract match the risk profile and objectives?
2. **Structure Clarity**: Is the product structure clear and comprehensive?
3. **Standards Coverage**: Are relevant AAOIFI standards properly referenced and explained?
4. **Compliance Analysis**: Are Shariah compliance concerns properly identified?
5. **Practical Viability**: Does the product design appear practically viable for implementation?
6. **Visual Presentation**: Are the diagrams and visualizations accurate and helpful?

## Documenting Test Results

For each test case, document:
1. Input parameters used
2. Summary of recommendations received
3. Screenshots of key output elements
4. Assessment against evaluation metrics
5. Any issues or areas for improvement identified

This documentation will be valuable for demonstrating the feature's capabilities during the hackathon judging and for future refinement of the system.
