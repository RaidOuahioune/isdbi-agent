# Standards Enhancement Results - FAS 10

## Trigger Scenario

A financial institution wants to structure an Istisna'a contract for the development 
                              of a large-scale AI software platform. The current wording of FAS 10 on 'well-defined 
                              subject matter' and 'determination of cost' is causing uncertainty for intangible assets 
                              like software development.

## Initial Analysis

## Enhancement Proposal

Okay, based on the analysis provided, here are proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 to address the application challenges for intangible assets like complex software development (AI platform).

Since the specific paragraph numbers and exact wording of the original text related to "well-defined subject matter" and "determination of cost" from FAS 10 were not provided in the analysis, the proposed changes will assume typical sections dealing with these requirements and use placeholder paragraph numbers [X], [Y], [Z], [W] which would need to be replaced with the actual standard's numbering.

**Proposed Enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10**

**Enhancement Area 1: Clarifying "Well-Defined Subject Matter" for Intangible Assets**

*   **Rationale:** The current standard's language and implicit examples are geared towards tangible assets, creating ambiguity when applying the requirement of a "well-defined subject matter" to intangible assets like software, especially complex and potentially evolving systems like AI platforms. This enhancement clarifies what constitutes a sufficient definition for intangible assets and how to treat subsequent changes within the Istisna'a framework.

*   **Original Text (Illustrative Placeholder):**
    [X]. The subject matter of the Istisna'a contract shall be clearly defined and specified in a manner that allows for its reliable identification, construction, or manufacture.

*   **Proposed Modified Text:**
    [X]. The subject matter of the Istisna'a contract shall be clearly defined and specified in a manner that allows for its reliable identification, construction, manufacture, *or development*. For intangible assets, such as software, this definition shall include detailed functional specifications, technical requirements, performance criteria, and other relevant characteristics necessary to define the intended outcome and allow for the reliable measurement of progress towards completion. While the initial contract requires a well-defined scope at inception, it is acknowledged that specifications for complex intangible assets may evolve during the development process. Significant changes to the initially defined scope shall be treated as contract modifications in accordance with paragraph [Y - *reference to the section on contract modifications*].

*   **Explanation of Change:**
    *   Added "or development" to acknowledge the nature of creating intangible assets.
    *   Explicitly included "intangible assets, such as software," to broaden the standard's scope.
    *   Defined what "well-defined" means in the context of software: "detailed functional specifications, technical requirements, performance criteria, and other relevant characteristics." This provides concrete criteria for assessment.
    *   Added a sentence acknowledging the reality of evolving specifications in complex intangible projects ("While the initial contract requires...").
    *   Clarified that "significant changes" are handled as contract modifications, directing users to the relevant section of the standard. This provides a structured approach for managing scope changes.

**Enhancement Area 2: Guidance on Determination of Cost for Software Development**

*   **Rationale:** The standard requires reliable determination of contract cost, typically listing components relevant to tangible goods/construction. This creates uncertainty about which costs are includible for software development, which is primarily labor-based with significant overhead and potential R&D overlap. This enhancement provides specific guidance on cost components for software and clarifies the treatment of elements like R&D within the project scope.

*   **Original Text (Illustrative Placeholder):**
    [Z]. The cost of an Istisna'a contract shall be reliably determined and shall include costs that relate directly to the specific contract and those that are attributable to contract activity in general and can be allocated to the contract.

*   **Proposed Modified Text:**
    [Z]. The cost of an Istisna'a contract shall be reliably determined and shall include costs that relate directly to the specific contract and those that are attributable to contract activity in general and can be allocated to the contract. For contracts involving the development of intangible assets such as software, contract costs shall include costs directly related to the development activity necessary to produce the specified asset. These typically comprise:
    (a) direct labor costs of personnel involved in the development process (e.g., developers, analysts, project managers, quality assurance);
    (b) allocated overhead directly attributable to the project (e.g., costs of development tools, infrastructure used specifically for the project, project-specific facilities);
    (c) other direct costs (e.g., costs of specific data sets, third-party components, or licenses acquired specifically for the project).
    Costs related to exploratory research or activities that do not directly contribute to the specific, defined features and functionality of the software asset shall be expensed as incurred. Costs incurred for iterative refinement, debugging, and testing necessary to achieve the specified functionality and quality of the software as defined in the contract shall be included in the contract cost. Reliable determination of contract cost requires the use of appropriate estimation methodologies that consider the nature and complexity of the subject matter. Changes in estimates of contract cost shall be accounted for in accordance with paragraph [W - *reference to the section on changes in estimates*].

*   **Explanation of Change:**
    *   Added "For contracts involving the development of intangible assets such as software..." to introduce specific guidance for this asset class.
    *   Provided a non-exhaustive list of typical cost components for software development (direct labor, allocated overhead, other direct costs), giving clarity on what should be included.
    *   Clarified the treatment of R&D: costs not directly contributing to the *specific, defined* asset are expensed, while development costs *for* the asset are included. This aligns with general accounting principles for internally developed intangibles while fitting the Istisna'a framework.
    *   Clarified that costs for "iterative refinement, debugging, and testing necessary to achieve the specified functionality and quality" are part of the contract cost, reflecting the reality of software development cycles.
    *   Emphasized the need for "appropriate estimation methodologies" for complex subject matter like software, acknowledging the inherent difficulty but requiring a robust approach.
    *   Directed users to the section on changes in estimates for handling revisions to cost projections.

These proposed enhancements aim to provide clarity and practical guidance within AAOIFI FAS 10 for applying the Istisna'a framework to intangible assets like complex software, addressing the specific ambiguities identified in the analysis regarding subject matter definition and cost determination. They maintain the core principles of Istisna'a and the standard while adapting them to modern asset types and development methodologies.

## Expert Discussion

### Round 1

#### Shariah Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposed enhancements address practical challenges in applying FAS 10 to intangible assets. Clarifying the "well-defined subject matter" and providing cost guidance for software development aligns with the need for clarity in Istisna'a contracts (Ma'loom al-wasf) and helps ensure reliable accounting, which supports transparency. Treating significant changes as contract modifications is consistent with Shariah principles requiring mutual consent for altering binding agreements.

**Concerns:**

-  Ensuring the initial definition of complex intangible assets like AI platforms meets the Shariah requirement of "Ma'loom al-wasf" at contract inception, despite acknowledging potential evolution.
-  Confirming that the process for handling "significant changes" as contract modifications fully adheres to Shariah principles of mutual consent and potential renegotiation of terms.

**Recommendations:**

-  Add guidance on what constitutes a sufficiently detailed initial definition for complex intangible assets to satisfy "Ma'loom al-wasf" at contract signing.
-  Emphasize that significant contract modifications necessitate explicit mutual agreement on all affected terms (scope, price, delivery).

#### Finance Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposal aims to enhance AAOIFI FAS 10 for intangible assets like software by clarifying subject matter definition and cost determination. It attempts to reconcile the Istisna'a framework with the realities of software development, acknowledging evolving specifications and providing specific cost component guidance. While a necessary step, it introduces complexities regarding the core Istisna'a requirement of a fixed, well-defined scope at inception.

**Concerns:**

-  Acknowledging "evolving specifications" risks undermining the fundamental Istisna'a requirement for a clearly defined subject matter at contract inception if not strictly managed as formal contract modifications.
-  Distinguishing capitalizable development costs from expensible R&D/exploratory costs for complex software like AI remains practically challenging, potentially impacting the reliability of cost measurement.

**Recommendations:**

-  Emphasize that significant specification changes *must* be treated as formal contract modifications, reinforcing the need for a sufficiently defined initial scope to qualify as Istisna'a.
-  Provide more detailed practical examples or case studies illustrating the distinction between capitalizable development costs and expensible R&D for intangible assets.

#### Standards Expert

**Analysis:**



**Concerns:**

-  The proposal may not sufficiently address the inherent uncertainty and iterative/exploratory nature of complex software/AI, potentially straining the 'well-defined subject matter' requirement and the suitability of Istisna'a for such projects.
-  There is a need for clearer alignment and cross-referencing with AAOIFI FAS 25 (Intangible Assets) to ensure consistent treatment of development costs and asset recognition principles.

**Recommendations:**

-  Introduce criteria within FAS 10 or accompanying guidance to help determine when a software development project is sufficiently "well-defined" and predictable to qualify for Istisna'a treatment, distinguishing it from R&D-heavy or highly uncertain projects.
-  Explicitly reference AAOIFI FAS 25 and clarify how the cost determination and recognition principles in FAS 10 align with or differ from the requirements for internally generated intangible assets under FAS 25.

### Round 2

#### Shariah Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposed enhancements attempt to adapt Istisna'a principles to intangible assets like software. Acknowledging evolving specifications challenges the core Shariah requirement of a well-defined subject matter (*Ma'loom al-wasf*) at contract inception. Handling changes as contract modifications is permissible but must strictly adhere to Shariah rules of mutual consent and clarity on all revised terms.

**Concerns:**

-  Ensuring the initial definition of complex software meets the *Ma'loom al-wasf* standard at contract inception, given the acknowledged potential for evolution.
-  Confirming that the process for handling "significant changes" as contract modifications fully adheres to Shariah principles of mutual consent and clarity on all affected terms.

**Recommendations:**

-  Strengthen guidance on what constitutes a sufficiently detailed *initial* definition for complex intangible assets to satisfy *Ma'loom al-wasf* at contract signing.
-  Explicitly state that significant contract modifications require formal, documented mutual agreement on all revised terms (scope, price, delivery schedule) to ensure Shariah compliance.

#### Finance Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposal attempts to adapt FAS 10 for intangible assets by clarifying subject matter definition and cost determination. While addressing practical challenges, it introduces complexities in maintaining the Istisna'a model's core requirements for a fixed, well-defined scope and reliable cost measurement, particularly for complex and evolving assets like AI platforms.

**Concerns:**

-  Acknowledging "evolving specifications" risks undermining the fundamental Istisna'a requirement for a clearly defined subject matter at contract inception if not strictly managed as formal contract modifications.
-  Distinguishing capitalizable development costs from expensible R&D/exploratory costs for complex software like AI remains practically challenging, potentially impacting the reliability of cost measurement.

**Recommendations:**

-  Emphasize that significant specification changes *must* be treated as formal contract modifications, reinforcing the need for a sufficiently defined initial scope to qualify as Istisna'a.
-  Provide more detailed practical examples or case studies illustrating the distinction between capitalizable development costs and expensible R&D for intangible assets.

#### Standards Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposal attempts to adapt FAS 10 for complex intangible assets by clarifying scope definition and cost. It raises fundamental questions about whether the Istisna'a structure is suitable for highly iterative or uncertain development and requires careful alignment with AAOIFI FAS 25 principles.

**Concerns:**

-  Straining the "well-defined subject matter" requirement for complex, evolving intangible assets within the Istisna'a framework.
-  Ensuring consistency and clear alignment with AAOIFI FAS 25 principles for intangible asset recognition and cost treatment.

**Recommendations:**

-  Introduce criteria to help determine the suitability of Istisna'a for specific intangible development projects based on their level of definition and certainty.
-  Add explicit cross-references and reconciliation guidance with AAOIFI FAS 25 regarding cost capitalization and asset recognition for intangible assets.

Applying it directly to intangible assets like complex software development, especially involving AI which can have evolving requirements and significant R&D components, presents challenges.\n\nHere\'s an analysis of how sections related to "well-defined subject matter" and "determination of cost" in FAS 10 may need enhancement to address this scenario:\n\n**Analysis of Potential Gaps/Ambiguities in FAS 10 for Intangible Software Development (AI Platform)**\n\n**1. Subject Matter Definition:**\n\n*   **Relevant Concept in Standard:** FAS 10 requires the Istisna\'a contract to have a "well-defined subject matter" with clear specifications. This is a fundamental Shariah requirement for Istisna\'a validity and accounting recognition. The standard typically assumes specifications related to physical attributes, materials, dimensions, functionality, etc., for a tangible item.\n*   **Potential Gap/Ambiguity:** The standard\'s language and examples are geared towards physical objects. Applying "well-defined subject matter" to complex intangible software, particularly an AI platform, is ambiguous.\n    *   **Specificity:** What constitutes "well-defined" for software? Is it a detailed functional specification document? Does it need to cover non-functional requirements like scalability, performance, and security exhaustively upfront?\n    *   **Evolution:** Software development, especially for innovative AI, often involves iterative processes (e.g., Agile methodologies) where specific features or even the *exact* scope can evolve based on testing, user feedback, and emerging technological capabilities. While the *core* concept is defined, the *specifics* might not be fully locked down at contract inception. The standard may not adequately address how to handle evolving specifications within the framework of a "well-defined" subject matter required for Istisna\'a.\n    *   **Intangibility:** The standard doesn\'t explicitly discuss applying Istisna\'a to purely intangible assets. While software is "built" or "developed," is it considered "manufactured" or "constructed" in the traditional sense implied by Istisna\'a and FAS 10?\n\n*   **Why this is an issue in the trigger scenario:** A large-scale AI platform involves complex algorithms, data pipelines, machine learning model training, integration with existing systems, user interfaces, and continuous improvement. Defining *all* aspects precisely at the start is often impractical or impossible. Uncertainty arises on:\n    *   Whether such a contract for an evolving intangible asset truly qualifies as a valid Istisna\'a under the standard\'s interpretation.\n    *   How changes in specifications during development are handled from an accounting perspective – are they contract modifications, or does the initial "well-defined" requirement imply a rigidity that is incompatible with modern software development?\n    *   How to objectively measure progress or completion when the "item" is not a physical object with measurable physical attributes.\n\n**2. Determination of Cost:**\n\n*   **Relevant Concept in Standard:** FAS 10 requires the cost of the Istisna\'a contract to be reliably determined. This forms the basis for applying the percentage-of-completion method (if applicable) or the completed-contract method. Costs typically include direct materials, direct labor, and attributable overhead.\n*   **Potential Gap/Ambiguity:** While the general principles of cost accounting apply, the *application* within the context of intangible software development under FAS 10 lacks specific guidance.\n    *   **Cost Components:** Software cost is primarily labor (developer salaries, project management, QA), significant overhead (infrastructure, tools, office space), and potentially data acquisition costs. The standard\'s framework, often implicitly assuming tangible inputs (materials), might not provide sufficient detail on how to categorize and attribute these predominantly intangible costs.\n    *   **Estimating Difficulty:** Estimating the total cost of a complex, innovative software project (especially AI, where R&D elements can be significant) is notoriously difficult and often involves high uncertainty. The standard\'s requirement for "reliable determination" might be interpreted rigidly, potentially making it difficult to apply the percentage-of-completion method if initial cost estimates are deemed insufficiently reliable due to the nature of the project.\n    *   **R&D Overlap:** AI development often involves elements of research and development (experimentation, trying different algorithms). How should costs associated with exploratory R&D *within* the project be treated? Are they project costs or expenses? FAS 10 doesn\'t provide specific guidance on distinguishing between development costs attributable to the specific asset (the platform) and more general R&D costs in this context.\n    *   **Bug Fixing/Refactoring:** Costs associated with fixing bugs or refactoring code are inherent in software development. How are these treated within the Istisna\'a cost framework? Are they part of the asset\'s cost or period expenses?\n\n*   **Why this is an issue in the trigger scenario:** For a large-scale AI platform, cost estimation is complex. The significant labor and overhead costs need clear attribution rules. The potential for scope changes, unforeseen technical challenges, and the iterative nature of AI development (e.g., training models requires experimentation) make reliable *initial* cost determination challenging. Lack of specific guidance in FAS 10 on these aspects creates uncertainty for the financial institution in applying the standard and subsequently measuring project profitability and asset value.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAAOIFI FAS 10 provides a solid framework for traditional Istisna\'a contracts involving tangible assets. However, its current wording regarding "well-defined subject matter" and "determination of cost" requires clarification or enhancement to effectively address the unique characteristics of intangible assets like complex software development, particularly for innovative technologies like AI.\n\nThe standard could be enhanced by:\n1.  Adding specific guidance or interpretations on the application of Istisna\'a to intangible assets, defining what constitutes "well-defined" for software.\n2.  Providing flexibility or clear rules on handling evolving specifications common in modern software development methodologies.\n3.  Offering more detailed guidance on the composition and reliable determination of costs specific to software development, including labor, overhead attribution, and the treatment of R&D elements or iterative refinement costs within the project.\n\nWithout such enhancements, financial institutions structuring Istisna\'a for software projects face significant uncertainty in applying the standard\'s requirements, potentially leading to inconsistent accounting practices.', 'enhancement_areas': ['Here are the key areas needing enhancement in AAOIFI FAS 10 based on the analysis for structuring an AI software platform contract:', '*   Adding specific guidance or interpretations on the application of Istisna\'a to intangible assets, including defining what constitutes a "well-defined subject matter" for software.', '*   Providing flexibility or clear rules on handling evolving specifications common in modern software development methodologies.', '*   Offering more detailed guidance on the composition and reliable determination of costs specific to software development, including labor, overhead attribution, and the treatment of R&D elements or iterative refinement costs within the project.']}, 'rationale': 'Okay, let\'s analyze AAOIFI FAS 10, "Accounting for Istisna\'a and Parallel Istisna\'a," in the context of structuring a contract for the development of a large-scale AI software platform.\n\nFAS 10, like the underlying Shariah concept of Istisna\'a, was primarily developed with tangible manufactured goods or construction projects in mind.

Istisna\'a requires the subject matter ("Al-Masnoo\'") to be "known and specified to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge" (FAS 10, Para 4/1/1). The proposed enhancement directly addresses the potential Gharar arising from the intangible and potentially evolving nature of software. By providing specific criteria for defining software (functional specs, technical requirements, performance criteria), it aims to ensure the subject matter is sufficiently defined *at contract inception* to reduce uncertainty. Acknowledging the possibility of evolution and directing significant changes to a contract modification process (which implies re-agreement on terms, including price/scope if necessary) is a Shariah-compliant way to handle changes in a binding contract, provided the initial contract met the definition requirement.\n    *   **Istisna\'a Foundation:** The legitimacy of Istisna\'a is based on *Istihsan* (juristic approbation) due to customary practice or on *Qiyas* and general rules/Maslaha (public good/need) (FAS 10, Para 3/1, 3/3). Applying Istisna\'a to software development addresses a modern need for financing the creation of intangible assets, aligning with the *Maslaha* principle. The proposed enhancements make the application of Istisna\'a to this new asset class more robust and less prone to Gharar by providing clear criteria for definition and cost.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The proposed enhancements are consistent with Shariah principles. They aim to mitigate Gharar by providing clearer guidance on defining intangible subject matter and reliably determining costs within the Istisna\'a framework, adapting the contract type to modern economic needs in a Shariah-compliant manner.\n\n2.  **Consistency Check:**\n    *   **Internal Consistency (within FAS 10):**\n        *   **Subject Matter:** The proposed clarification on "well-defined subject matter" for intangible assets aligns with and expands upon the existing requirement in FAS 10 (Para 4/1/1) without contradicting it. It provides practical criteria for this specific asset class. Referring significant changes to contract modifications is consistent with the standard\'s existing treatment of change orders and additional claims (Para 24-26). *Consistent.*\n        *   **Cost Determination:** The proposed list of cost components (direct labor, allocated overhead, other direct costs) is a practical application of the existing definition of Istisna\'a costs as consisting of "Direct costs, in particular costs of producing Al-Masnoo’; and (II) Indirect costs relating to the contract as allocated on an objective basis" (FAS 10, Para 2/1(a)). However, FAS 10 Para 2/1(a) *explicitly states* that "research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna’a contract costs." The proposal attempts to distinguish between exploratory R&D (expensed) and development *for the specific asset* (included in cost), which aligns with general accounting principles (e.g., IAS 38 for internally developed intangibles) but *directly contradicts* the blanket exclusion of R&D costs in FAS 10 Para 2/1(a). This is a significant inconsistency that needs to be addressed.\n        *   **Reliable Estimation:** The emphasis on reliable estimation methodologies for costs aligns with the requirement for applying the percentage-of-completion method (FAS 10, Para 19, Appendix E). *Consistent.*\n    *   **Consistency with other related standards:** The provided excerpts from FAS 4 (Musharaka) and FAS 7 (Salam) acknowledge intangible assets and valuation methods (fair value in Musharaka context). The proposed enhancement\'s recognition of intangible assets as valid subject matter for Istisna\'a is broadly consistent with the recognition of intangibles in other standards, although the specific accounting treatment (cost determination for Istisna\'a vs. valuation for Musharaka capital) differs as appropriate for the contract type. No direct contradictions with the provided excerpts from other standards were found. *Consistent.*\n\n3.  **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n    *   **Subject Matter Definition:** The proposed definition using functional specifications, technical requirements, and performance criteria reflects standard practices in software development contracting. Acknowledging the iterative nature and using change orders is also highly practical for complex software projects, providing a necessary framework for managing scope evolution. *Practical.*\n    *   **Cost Determination:** The proposed breakdown of software costs (labor, overhead, etc.) is aligned with standard cost accounting practices for development projects. Distinguishing between general R&D and project-specific development costs is also a practical necessity for accurate project costing and aligns with common accounting treatments for internally developed software. This provides much-needed practical guidance for financial institutions applying FAS 10 to software. *Highly Practical.*\n    *   **Overall:** The proposal directly addresses the practical challenges identified in the trigger scenario and analysis, providing clear, implementable guidance for applying Istisna\'a to software development.\n\n4.  **Final Decision:**\n\nThe proposed enhancement provides valuable and practical clarity for applying AAOIFI FAS 10 to intangible assets like software, which is a growing area for Islamic finance. It is Shariah-compliant and largely consistent with the standard\'s framework.\n\nHowever, there is a direct and significant inconsistency with the existing FAS 10, Para 2/1(a), which explicitly excludes "research and development costs" from Istisna\'a contract costs. The proposal includes costs related to development *for the specific asset*, which may be considered a form of R&D depending on definition. This conflict must be resolved.\n\nTherefore, the proposal **NEEDS REVISION**.\n\n**Detailed Feedback for Revision:**\n\n1.  **Address the Conflict with FAS 10, Para 2/1(a):** The most critical issue is the contradiction regarding R&D/development costs. The standard currently excludes *all* R&D costs. The proposal includes development costs *for the specific asset*. To resolve this, either:\n    *   Modify Para 2/1(a) to make an exception for development costs of intangible assets that directly contribute to the specified subject matter. For example, "General research and development costs shall not be included in an Istisna’a contract costs, *except for costs of developing intangible assets that are directly attributable to bringing the specified asset to its intended use*."\n    *   Alternatively, clarify within the proposed text for intangible assets that the costs included are those falling under \'Direct costs\' or \'Indirect costs relating to the contract\' as defined in 2/1(a), and explicitly define how "research and development costs" (which are excluded) differ from "development activity necessary to produce the specified asset" (which are included). This would likely require a more nuanced definition of R&D vs. development *within the context of Istisna\'a for intangibles* than currently exists in FAS 10.\n\n2.  **Placeholder References:** Ensure the placeholder paragraph numbers ([X], [Y], [Z], [W]) are replaced with the actual paragraph numbers from FAS 10 during the formal drafting process.\n\n3.  **Refine Terminology (Optional but Recommended):** While "manufacture or construction" can be stretched to include "development," using terms like "creation" or "development" consistently when referring to intangible assets could enhance clarity. The proposal does this well by adding "or development".\n\nIn summary, the proposal is excellent in its intent and practical guidance but requires a specific revision to align the treatment of development costs with the existing text of FAS 10, Para 2/1(a). Once this inconsistency is resolved, the enhancement would significantly improve the applicability of FAS 10 to modern intangible assets.'}
