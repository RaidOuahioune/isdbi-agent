# Standards Enhancement Results - FAS 32

## Trigger Scenario

Islamic financial institutions are increasingly issuing 'Green Sukuk' to fund 
                              environmentally sustainable projects, but FAS 32 lacks specific guidance on how to account 
                              for and report environmental impact metrics alongside financial returns.

## Initial Analysis

## Enhancement Proposal

Okay, Mr./Ms./Mx. Standards Enhancement Proposer Agent. Based on the reviewer's analysis of AAOIFI FAS 32 and the identified gap regarding reporting of non-financial impacts for instruments like Green Sukuk, I will now propose specific enhancements to the standard text.

As highlighted by the reviewer, the provided snippet concerning a transitional provision is not relevant to the identified gap. The core issue is the *absence* of requirements for non-financial impact reporting within the standard's scope, particularly in the disclosure section.

Therefore, the proposed enhancements focus on adding new requirements to address this critical gap, rather than modifying the provided irrelevant snippet.

---

**Proposed Enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 32: Investment Accounts**

**Issue Addressed:** Lack of specific guidance on accounting for and reporting environmental and other non-financial impact metrics for Investment Accounts funding projects with stated non-financial objectives (e.g., Green Sukuk).

**Approach:** Add new disclosure requirements and related guidance within FAS 32 to mandate the reporting of non-financial impacts for relevant Investment Accounts.

**1. Proposed Addition: Introduction/Scope Section**

*   **Rationale:** To explicitly acknowledge that certain Investment Accounts may have stated non-financial objectives (e.g., environmental, social) in addition to financial ones, setting the context for subsequent impact reporting requirements. This aligns the standard with the evolving landscape of Islamic finance instruments like Green/Social Sukuk.

*   **Original Text (Implied lack of explicit mention):** The current introduction/scope focuses on the financial nature and treatment of Investment Accounts.

*   **Proposed Modified Text (Addition):**
    *   *Insert the following text within an appropriate section of the Introduction or Scope, perhaps following paragraphs describing the nature of Investment Accounts:*
        "Furthermore, institutions may establish Investment Accounts where the underlying investments are specifically directed towards projects or activities with stated non-financial objectives, such as environmental sustainability (e.g., renewable energy, green infrastructure) or social development (e.g., affordable housing, healthcare). While the primary accounting requirements of this standard relate to the financial aspects of such accounts, the institution shall also consider the importance of disclosing information regarding the achievement of these stated non-financial objectives where material to understanding the investment's purpose and performance from a stakeholder perspective."

**2. Proposed Addition: Disclosure Section**

*   **Rationale:** This is the primary section requiring enhancement. Adding specific mandatory disclosure requirements ensures institutions provide transparent and comparable information on the non-financial impacts achieved by the underlying projects funded through these Investment Accounts. This directly addresses the need for accountability, prevents greenwashing, and meets investor/stakeholder expectations.

*   **Original Text (Implied lack of specific non-financial disclosures):** The current disclosure section focuses on financial information, risk exposures, profit/loss allocation basis, etc.

*   **Proposed Modified Text (Addition):**
    *   *Add a new sub-section within the existing Disclosure section (e.g., as a new paragraph or a sub-heading under General Disclosures or specific Investment Account disclosures):*
        "**Disclosure of Non-Financial Impact for Specific Investment Accounts**

        For Investment Accounts whose underlying investments are directed towards projects or activities with stated material non-financial objectives (e.g., environmental or social), the institution shall disclose relevant information enabling users to understand the performance against these objectives. This disclosure shall include, but not be limited to:

        (a) A description of the stated non-financial objectives of the underlying investments (e.g., reduction of carbon emissions, generation of renewable energy, creation of social housing units).
        (b) Identification of the key non-financial impact metrics used to measure progress towards these objectives (e.g., tonnes of CO2 equivalent reduced, MWh of renewable energy generated, number of housing units provided).
        (c) A description of the methodology and assumptions used to measure and calculate these non-financial impact metrics.
        (d) The actual non-financial impact achieved during the reporting period, quantified using the identified metrics, where practicable and verifiable.
        (e) Any significant challenges encountered in achieving the non-financial objectives or measuring the impact.
        (f) A qualitative description of the project's contribution to broader environmental or social goals, as applicable.

        Where quantitative measurement of impact is not practicable or verifiable with reasonable effort, the institution shall disclose the reasons and provide relevant qualitative information about the project's activities and expected contributions to the non-financial objectives."

**3. Proposed Addition: Definitions Section (Optional, but Recommended)**

*   **Rationale:** To provide clarity and consistency if the standard introduces terms like "Non-Financial Objectives" or "Impact Investment Account." This helps ensure consistent application of the new disclosure requirements.

*   **Original Text (Likely no definitions for these specific terms):**

*   **Proposed Modified Text (Addition):**
    *   *If a Definitions section exists, add the following definitions:*
        "**Non-Financial Objectives:** Refers to specific, measurable, and time-bound goals related to environmental sustainability, social development, or governance outcomes, which are explicitly stated as aims for investments made using funds from certain Investment Accounts.

        **Non-Financial Impact Metrics:** Quantifiable measures used to track and report the progress and outcomes of investments towards stated Non-Financial Objectives (e.g., reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, increase in access to clean water, number of jobs created)."

**4. Proposed Addition: Basis of Measurement/Presentation (Guidance within Disclosure)**

*   **Rationale:** While the standard doesn't need to prescribe specific environmental measurement standards (as these evolve rapidly and are often industry-specific), it should require disclosure of the *basis* used and encourage presentation that links financial and non-financial performance where relevant.

*   **Original Text (Focuses on financial measurement principles):**

*   **Proposed Modified Text (Addition - can be integrated into the Disclosure section addition above, specifically points (c) and (f)):**
    *   *Ensure the disclosure text explicitly requires:*
        *   Disclosure of the *methodology and assumptions* used for measurement (as in 2c).
        *   Consideration of how the non-financial impact relates to the overall performance or purpose of the investment (as in 2f, and implicitly in the introductory text addition).

**Overall Rationale for Proposed Changes:**

These proposed enhancements directly address the gap identified in the analysis. By explicitly requiring the disclosure of non-financial objectives, metrics, methodologies, and achieved impacts for relevant Investment Accounts (such as those funding Green Sukuk), AAOIFI FAS 32 would:

1.  **Increase Transparency:** Provide users with essential information about the non-financial performance of investments designed to achieve specific environmental or social goals.
2.  **Enhance Accountability:** Hold institutions accountable for delivering on the stated objectives of instruments like Green Sukuk.
3.  **Combat Greenwashing:** Provide a standardized basis for reporting, making it harder to misrepresent the environmental credentials of investments.
4.  **Meet Stakeholder Needs:** Align financial reporting with the growing demand from investors, regulators, and the public for information on the broader impact of financial activities.
5.  **Maintain Compatibility:** The proposed changes are additions to the disclosure requirements and introductory text, which can be integrated without fundamentally altering the core financial accounting principles or measurement bases already established in FAS 32. They build upon the existing framework by adding a layer of relevant, non-financial information where the nature of the investment warrants it.

These changes would significantly modernize FAS 32 and make it more relevant to the innovative and impact-focused instruments emerging within the Islamic finance industry.

## Expert Discussion

### Round 1

#### Shariah Expert

**Analysis:**



#### Finance Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposal accurately identifies a gap in AAOIFI FAS 32 concerning non-financial impact reporting for instruments like Green Sukuk. Adding disclosure requirements is a relevant approach to enhance transparency and address evolving stakeholder demands for sustainability information. This aligns with responsible Islamic finance principles.

**Concerns:**

-  Lack of standardized methodologies for non-financial impact measurement poses challenges for comparability and verification.
-  Determining the scope of "material non-financial objectives" and the practicality of measurement for diverse projects could be subjective.

**Recommendations:**

-  Develop accompanying implementation guidance providing examples of relevant metrics, methodologies, and verification approaches.
-  Clearly define criteria for identifying relevant Investment Accounts and assessing materiality of non-financial objectives within the standard or guidance.

#### Standards Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposal correctly identifies a gap regarding non-financial impact reporting for instruments like Green Sukuk. However, integrating detailed non-financial metrics and methodologies into a financial accounting standard (FAS 32) risks diluting its focus and may not be the most structurally appropriate approach within the AAOIFI framework.

**Concerns:**

-  **Scope Creep in FAS 32:** Mandating detailed non-financial reporting within a financial accounting standard may exceed its intended scope and area of expertise.
-  **Lack of Integration:** The proposal doesn't explicitly consider how these requirements would interact with broader sustainability reporting frameworks or potential dedicated AAOIFI guidance on ESG/impact.

**Recommendations:**

-  Evaluate developing a separate AAOIFI standard or guidance specifically for sustainability/impact reporting by IFIs, which could reference relevant financial standards.
-  If enhancing FAS 32, limit requirements to high-level disclosure of stated objectives and reference to separate, comprehensive impact reports prepared elsewhere.

### Round 2

#### Shariah Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposal to mandate non-financial impact reporting for relevant Investment Accounts aligns with the Maqasid al-Shariah (objectives of Islamic law) by promoting transparency, accountability, and investments that generate positive societal and environmental outcomes. This enhances the ethical dimension of Islamic finance by ensuring institutions demonstrate the real-world impact of instruments like Green Sukuk.

**Concerns:**

- Risk of 'impact washing' if disclosures lack robust methodology, verification, and independent assurance.
- Ensuring the definition and measurement of "non-financial objectives" and "impacts" are consistent with broader Shariah principles and ethical considerations.

**Recommendations:**

- Emphasize the Shariah requirement for honesty and accuracy in reporting, potentially requiring external verification for material impact disclosures.
- Explicitly link the non-financial objectives and reported impacts back to the ethical framework and Maqasid al-Shariah.

#### Finance Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposal accurately identifies a critical gap in FAS 32 regarding reporting non-financial impacts for relevant Investment Accounts. Adding disclosure requirements is essential for transparency and accountability in instruments like Green Sukuk. However, integrating detailed non-financial metrics into a financial standard presents significant challenges for standardization and comparability.

**Concerns:**

-  Lack of standardized Islamic finance-specific non-financial metrics hinders comparability across institutions.
-  Including detailed non-financial reporting requirements risks scope creep within a financial accounting standard.

**Recommendations:**

-  Limit FAS 32 enhancements to requiring disclosure of stated non-financial objectives and a summary reference to where detailed impact reports can be found.
-  Develop separate AAOIFI guidance or a standard dedicated to comprehensive sustainability and impact reporting by IFIs.

#### Standards Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposal aims to integrate detailed non-financial impact reporting into AAOIFI FAS 32, a financial accounting standard. This approach may cause structural misalignment within the AAOIFI framework, potentially exceeding the intended scope of a FAS and complicating future integration with broader sustainability reporting efforts.

**Concerns:**

-  **Scope Creep:** Mandating detailed non-financial metrics within a financial accounting standard dilutes its focus and may not be the optimal structural placement within AAOIFI.
-  **Lack of Framework Alignment:** Integration into FAS 32 doesn't consider the development of a potential dedicated AAOIFI sustainability/ESG reporting standard or guidance.

**Recommendations:**

-  Evaluate developing a separate AAOIFI standard or guidance specifically for sustainability/impact reporting by IFIs.
-  Limit any immediate FAS 32 changes to high-level disclosures referencing non-financial objectives and directing users to separate, comprehensive impact reports.

It does not currently mandate or provide guidance on the measurement, recognition, or reporting of *non-financial* impacts, such as environmental metrics (e.g., carbon emissions reduced, renewable energy generated, waste diverted) or social metrics (e.g., jobs created, communities impacted), even when the underlying investment (like a Green Sukuk) is specifically designed to achieve such impacts.\n    *   **Ambiguity:** While the standard requires disclosure related to the *nature* of the investment and the *basis* for profit/loss allocation, there is no ambiguity about whether *environmental impact* should be included – it is simply not addressed at all within the standard\'s requirements. The ambiguity lies not *within* the standard itself regarding environmental reporting, but in how institutions *should* report on the environmental aspects of instruments like Green Sukuk when the relevant accounting standard (FAS 32, often applicable to the underlying funding structure) is silent on the matter.\n\n3.  **Why This Might Be an Issue in the Context of the Trigger Scenario:**\n    *   **Investor Expectations:** Investors in Green Sukuk are often motivated by both financial returns and the desire to fund environmentally positive projects. They need reliable, comparable information on the *actual environmental impact* achieved to assess the success of their investment against its stated purpose.\n    *   **Transparency and Accountability:** Without standardized reporting requirements for environmental impact under relevant accounting standards like FAS 32 (which would apply to the related investment account structures), institutions may report impact inconsistently or not at all. This hinders transparency and makes institutions less accountable for delivering on the "green" promise.\n    *   **Preventing Greenwashing:** Lack of mandatory, standardized environmental impact reporting increases the risk of "greenwashing," where instruments are labeled "green" without clear, verifiable evidence of environmental benefit.\n    *   **Stakeholder Information Needs:** Regulators, the public, and other stakeholders are increasingly demanding information on the environmental and social performance of financial institutions and the instruments they issue. FAS 32, in its current form, does not help meet this need for Green Sukuk related investments.\n    *   **Integration Challenge:** The current structure separates financial reporting (under FAS standards like FAS 32) from non-financial impact reporting (which might fall under separate sustainability or ESG frameworks, if reported at all).

This could include:\n            *   Defining key environmental metrics relevant to common project types (e.g., MWh of renewable energy, tonnes of CO2 equivalent reduced, cubic meters of water saved).\n            *   Requiring disclosure of methodologies used for measuring these impacts.\n            *   Mandating reporting of actual impact achieved during the reporting period.\n            *   Requiring qualitative disclosures about the project\'s contribution to environmental goals.\n            *   Discussing the relationship (if any) between financial performance and environmental impact achievement.\n        *   **Definitions:** Potentially adding definitions for terms like "Green Investment Account" or "Environmental Impact Metrics" in the context of the standard.\n        *   **Basis of Measurement/Presentation:** While impact metrics are non-financial, guidance on their presentation alongside financial information or as supplementary information could be beneficial.\n\nIn conclusion, while the provided snippet is irrelevant to environmental reporting, FAS 32 as a whole lacks the necessary provisions to ensure transparent and standardized reporting of environmental impacts for instruments like Green Sukuk, creating a significant gap that needs to be addressed to meet evolving market expectations and ensure the integrity of the "green" label in Islamic finance.', 'enhancement_areas': ['Here are the key areas needing enhancement from the analysis, presented as a list:', '1.  **Introduction/Scope:** Needs enhancement to acknowledge the growing importance of non-financial objectives in certain types of Investment Accounts (like those funding Green Sukuk projects).', '2.  **Disclosure Section:** Requires the addition of specific requirements for disclosing non-financial impact metrics (e.g., environmental, social) for relevant Investment Accounts.

The core financial accounting principles within FAS 32, which must comply with Shariah, remain untouched.\n*   **Relevance to Principles:**\n    *   **Transparency and Fairness:** Requiring disclosure of non-financial impacts directly aligns with the Shariah principles of Transparency and Fairness. Investors and stakeholders in instruments like Green Sukuk are often motivated by the stated environmental or social objectives. Providing clear, standardized information on the achievement of these objectives enhances transparency and allows stakeholders to make informed decisions and hold institutions accountable.\n    *   **Ethical Investment:** Islamic finance inherently promotes ethical and socially responsible investments. Reporting on the positive environmental or social impact of relevant investments reinforces this principle and helps demonstrate adherence to the broader goals of Islamic finance beyond mere Shariah compliance of the contract structure. It supports the concept of *Maslaha* (public good).\n    *   **Other Principles (Riba, Gharar, Maysir, Asset-Backing, Risk-Sharing):** The proposed disclosure requirements do not introduce or facilitate any prohibited elements like Riba, Gharar, or Maysir. They do not contradict the principles of asset-backing or risk-sharing, which relate to the financial structure and risk distribution of the underlying investments.\n*   **Conclusion:** The proposed enhancement is fully compliant with core Shariah principles. It promotes transparency, fairness, and the ethical dimension of Islamic finance without affecting the Shariah compliance of the underlying financial transactions.\n\n**2. Consistency Check:**\n\n*   **Consistency with FAS 32:** FAS 32 currently focuses on the financial accounting and reporting of Investment Accounts. The proposal adds a layer of *non-financial* disclosure for a specific subset of these accounts (those with stated non-financial objectives). This is an *addition* to the standard\'s requirements, addressing a known gap in reporting for evolving instruments like Green Sukuk. It does not contradict or require changes to the existing financial recognition, measurement, or presentation principles within FAS 32. It builds upon the standard by requiring additional, relevant information where applicable.\n*   **Consistency with Related Standards:** The provided snippets from FAS 4 (Musharaka), FAS 7 (Salam), FAS 10 (Istisna\'a), and FAS 28 (Murabaha/Deferred Payment Sales) primarily discuss financial accounting treatments and their Shariah basis (e.g., measurement of capital, profit recognition, clarity of subject matter to avoid Gharar). These standards do not currently mandate non-financial impact reporting. However, the principle of providing useful and relevant information to users of financial statements is a foundation across AAOIFI standards, as referenced in the Basis for Conclusions sections (e.g., alignment with the Statement of Objectives and Concepts). The proposed enhancement aligns with this overarching principle by requiring disclosure of information that is highly relevant to the stated purpose of certain investment accounts and their underlying projects. While it sets a precedent for non-financial reporting within AAOIFI FAS, it does not create a conflict with the existing standards; rather, it represents an evolution to meet new reporting needs.\n*   **Conclusion:** The proposed changes maintain internal consistency within FAS 32 by adding disclosure requirements without altering core financial principles. They are also consistent with the broader AAOIFI framework\'s objective of providing relevant and transparent information, even if they introduce a new type of disclosure not yet widespread in other standards.\n\n**3. Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n\n*   **Feasibility:** The proposed disclosures (stated objectives, key metrics, methodology, achieved impact, challenges, qualitative description) are aligned with common practices in sustainability and ESG reporting frameworks (e.g., GRI, SASB, TCFD). Institutions issuing Green Sukuk or similar instruments are typically already engaging in some level of reporting on the non-financial aspects of their financed projects to meet investor expectations and comply with external guidelines (like the ICMA Green Bond Principles).\n*   **Challenges:** The most significant practical challenge lies in the quantitative measurement and verification of non-financial impacts (point 2d). This often requires specific expertise, data collection mechanisms, and potentially third-party verification.\n*   **Mitigation in Proposal:** The proposal addresses this challenge by including the crucial phrase "where practicable and verifiable." This allows institutions flexibility and requires disclosure of reasons when quantitative measurement is not feasible, permitting qualitative reporting instead. This makes the requirement practical while still pushing for measurement where possible.\n*   **Overall:** The requirements are generally practical for institutions already involved in financing projects with stated non-financial objectives. They formalize and standardize reporting practices that are emerging in the market.\n\n**4. Final Decision:**\n\n*   **Decision:** APPROVED\n\n*   **Detailed Reasoning:**\n    The proposed enhancement to AAOIFI FAS 32 is **APPROVED** because it successfully addresses a critical gap in the standard identified by the trigger scenario concerning the reporting of non-financial impacts for Investment Accounts funding projects with stated non-financial objectives (such as Green Sukuk).\n\n    1.  **Shariah Compliance:** The proposal is fully compliant with Shariah principles, particularly Transparency, Fairness, and the spirit of Ethical Investment (Maslaha). It promotes accountability for the stated environmental and social objectives of relevant investments, which is a positive development fully aligned with Islamic finance values. It does not introduce any prohibited elements into the accounting or reporting framework.\n    2.  **Consistency:** The proposed changes are presented as additions to the disclosure requirements and introductory context, which are consistent with the structure and purpose of FAS 32. They do not conflict with the existing financial accounting principles within FAS 32 or the fundamental principles found in other related AAOIFI standards. By requiring disclosure of relevant non-financial information for specific types of investment accounts, it enhances the overall relevance and usefulness of financial reporting in line with the objectives of AAOIFI standards.\n    3.  **Practicality:** The proposed disclosure requirements align with evolving practices in sustainable finance reporting. The inclusion of the caveat "where practicable and verifiable" for quantitative impact measurement provides necessary flexibility and makes the standard implementable, acknowledging the potential challenges in data collection and verification for non-financial metrics.\n\n    This enhancement is a necessary step for AAOIFI standards to remain relevant in the face of innovative, impact-driven Islamic finance instruments like Green Sukuk. It strengthens the integrity and transparency of such instruments by bringing their stated non-financial objectives into the formal financial reporting framework.'}
