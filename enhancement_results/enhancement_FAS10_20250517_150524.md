# Standards Enhancement Results - FAS 10

## Trigger Scenario

A financial institution wants to structure an Istisna'a contract for the development 
                              of a large-scale AI software platform. The current wording of FAS 10 on 'well-defined 
                              subject matter' and 'determination of cost' is causing uncertainty for intangible assets 
                              like software development.

#### Shariah Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 aim to modernize the application of the Istisna'a contract, specifically addressing the increasing need to finance and account for the development of intangible assets like software and digital services. From a Shariah perspective, the fundamental permissibility of applying Istisna'a to such subject matter is supported by AAOIFI's existing framework, particularly footnote (7) of FAS 10 which already broadens the definition of Al-Masnoo' to include services or both goods and services. The proposals build upon this established basis by providing practical guidance on how to apply the standard's requirements to these intangible deliverables.

Proposal 1 directly addresses the critical Shariah requirement of specifying the subject matter (Al-Masnoo') to avoid *Gharar* (excessive uncertainty). The original text's examples are limited to tangible assets, creating ambiguity for intangibles. The proposed text expands these examples to explicitly include intangible assets and suggests relevant metrics (performance, functional requirements, technical standards) for defining 'Quality' and 'Quantity'. This aligns well with the Shariah principle of clear specification (Wasf Dhabit) by providing concrete, albeit intangible, characteristics that can be defined and verified in a contract for software or digital services. This clarification is necessary to ensure the validity of Istisna'a contracts for such assets.

Proposal 2 tackles the treatment of R&D costs. The existing exclusion of "research and development costs" is problematic for innovative intangible development where R&D activities are often intertwined with contract execution. The proposed distinction between research *prior to or independent of* a specific contract (excluded) and development *directly attributable* to the contracted Al-Masnoo' (included) is sound from a Shariah perspective. The contract in Istisna'a is for the creation of a *specific* item. Costs directly incurred to bring that specific item into existence are logically part of the cost of production. General R&D, which may benefit multiple potential future projects or represents speculative exploration, is not directly tied to the specific contracted deliverable and therefore should be excluded. This revised wording provides a more nuanced and Shariah-compliant approach by aligning costs with the specific subject matter of the contract.

Proposal 3 provides guidance on cost estimation and percentage-of-completion measurement for intangible assets. While the percentage-of-completion method is an accounting principle rather than a direct Shariah ruling, the underlying need for reliable measurement and estimation aligns with the broader Shariah objective of ensuring clarity and avoiding excessive risk in financial transactions. The standard requires "reasonable accuracy" in cost estimation. The proposed methods (input, output based on milestones/functionalities, surveys) are appropriate for measuring progress in intangible development and are comparable in principle to methods used for tangible assets (e.g., physical milestones). The guidance on improving cost estimation for intangibles (detailed plans, tracking systems, regular review) helps institutions meet the "reasonable accuracy" requirement in a practical manner for these complex projects. This supports accurate financial reporting, which is beneficial for transparency and prudent management, indirectly supporting the Maqasid al-Shari'ah related to financial dealings.

Overall, the proposals appear to be well-considered attempts to adapt the existing Istisna'a framework within AAOIFI standards to the realities of modern intangible asset development, while maintaining adherence to core Shariah principles, particularly the avoidance of Gharar through clear specification and the proper allocation of costs related to the contracted item.

**Concerns:**

-  While Proposal 1 provides examples of how to specify intangible assets, there is a potential concern regarding the *level* of detail required in the actual contract to sufficiently remove *Gharar*. Intangible assets, especially complex ones like AI platforms, can be highly abstract and subject to changing requirements during development. The standard should emphasize that the contractual specification (using the proposed metrics) must be robust enough at the outset to clearly define the expected deliverable and minimize ambiguity that could lead to disputes or uncertainty about the subject matter, which is a core Shariah requirement for Istisna'a validity.
-  The distinction in Proposal 2 between "development activities directly attributable" and excluded R&D, while conceptually sound, may be challenging to apply consistently in practice for highly innovative technology projects. Without further practical guidance or examples, institutions might struggle to draw a clear line, potentially leading to inconsistent accounting treatment or disputes regarding cost allocation.

**Recommendations:**

-  Add a clause or footnote under the proposed text for 4/1/1 emphasizing that for intangible assets, the contractual documentation (including technical specifications, functional requirements, etc.) must be sufficiently detailed at the time of contracting to provide a clear and unambiguous description of Al-Masnoo' and eliminate material *Gharar* regarding its nature, quality, and scope.
-  Consider developing further implementation guidance (perhaps in an appendix or separate document) that provides practical examples and criteria for differentiating between "development activities directly attributable" to a specific contracted intangible asset and general R&D or pre-contract costs in the context of technology and software development projects, to aid consistent application of Proposal 2.

**Analysis:**

The proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 are well-reasoned and necessary to effectively apply the standard to Istisna'a contracts involving intangible assets, particularly software and digital platforms. The original FAS 10, while fundamentally sound, was developed with tangible assets (like construction) primarily in mind, leading to practical difficulties when applied to the development of bespoke intangible goods.

Proposal 1 directly addresses the Shari'ah requirement of specifying Al-Masnoo' by providing relevant examples and interpretations suitable for intangibles. From an accounting perspective, a clear definition of the subject matter is foundational for tracking costs and measuring progress towards completion. Expanding the examples for 'Kind', 'Type', 'Quality', and 'Quantity' to include intangible-specific descriptors (like performance metrics, functional requirements, users supported, scope of features) provides a much clearer basis for defining the scope of work. This clarity is essential for reliable cost estimation and progress measurement, which are prerequisites for applying the percentage-of-completion method (as outlined in FAS 10, paras 8 & 9).

Proposal 2 clarifies the treatment of research and development costs. The original exclusion of all "research and development costs" (para 2/1(a)) is problematic for modern technology development where significant 'development' activity is often directly tied to creating a specific, contracted asset. The proposed distinction between general research/prior development and contract-specific development costs aligns the accounting treatment with the economic reality of Istisna'a, where costs directly incurred to produce the contracted asset are capitalized as work-in-progress (para 2/1(a), 2/2(a), and illustrated in Document 1 example showing "Istisna'a costs"). This refinement is crucial for accurately measuring the cost of the Istisna'a asset and subsequently determining the contract's profitability under the percentage-of-completion method.

Proposal 3 provides much-needed guidance on applying the percentage-of-completion method (FAS 10, para 8) to intangible assets. It acknowledges the challenges in cost estimation and progress measurement compared to tangible assets and offers specific methods (input, output, survey) suitable for software/intangible development. The guidance on achieving "reasonable accuracy" (FAS 10, para 9) in cost estimation by using project plans, tracking systems, and regular reviews is practical and addresses a significant hurdle in applying the standard to this domain. This guidance enhances the reliability of revenue and profit recognition for such contracts and supports the presentation of Istisna'a work-in-progress on the statement of financial position (as shown in Document 3).

Collectively, these proposals enhance the clarity, applicability, and reliability of financial reporting under FAS 10 for a growing class of Istisna'a contracts involving intangible assets. They maintain consistency with the core principles of FAS 10 while adapting them to a modern context.

**Concerns:**

-  **Subjectivity in Cost Estimation and Progress Measurement:** While Proposal 3 provides helpful guidance, the inherent nature of developing complex, innovative intangible assets means that cost estimation and progress measurement can remain highly subjective and prone to significant revisions. The "reasonable accuracy" threshold required by FAS 10 (para 9) might still be difficult to consistently demonstrate, potentially leading to volatility in reported profits as estimates are updated.
-  **Distinguishing Contract-Specific Development from General R&D in Practice:** Proposal 2's distinction between contract-specific development and general R&D is conceptually sound. However, in real-world agile development or cutting-edge technology projects, activities can serve both specific contract requirements and general technological advancement. Applying this distinction consistently and objectively for cost capitalization purposes may require significant judgment and sophisticated cost tracking systems, which could be challenging for reporting entities.

**Recommendations:**

-  **Provide Detailed Guidance on Managing and Disclosing Estimation Uncertainty and Revisions:** Supplement the guidance in Proposal 3 with more explicit direction on how to handle significant uncertainty in cost estimates for complex intangibles. This could include: *   Criteria or indicators for when the "reasonable accuracy" condition might *not* be met, guiding entities towards using the completed-contract method in such cases. *   Detailed examples illustrating the impact of significant revisions to cost estimates on current and future period profit recognition under the percentage-of-completion method. *   Recommendations for enhanced disclosures regarding the assumptions and methodologies used for cost estimation and progress measurement for intangible Istisna'a contracts, and the impact of changes in estimates.
-  **Include Illustrative Examples for R&D Cost Capitalization:** To support the application of Proposal 2, include detailed illustrative examples demonstrating how to distinguish between general research/prior development costs (expensed) and contract-specific development costs (capitalized) in various scenarios involving intangible asset development (e.g., software modules, AI algorithms, digital platforms). This would provide practical guidance for applying the clarified definition.

#### Standards Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 demonstrate a clear understanding of the challenges in applying the standard to modern, complex intangible assets like software platforms.
Proposal 1 directly addresses the ambiguity in specifying Al-Masnoo' by expanding the examples under Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity to explicitly include intangible assets and relevant metrics (performance, functional requirements, scope, capacity). This is a necessary and logical extension of the existing text, aligning it with the standard's allowance for services or both as subject matter (as mentioned in the rationale). The revised wording is clear and provides practical guidance for contract drafting.
Proposal 2 tackles the problematic blanket exclusion of "research and development costs." By differentiating between research activities prior to/independent of a contract and development activities directly attributable to creating the specific contracted asset, the proposal provides a more nuanced and economically rational approach to cost capitalization for bespoke intangible development. This clarifies that costs incurred specifically to build the agreed-upon Al-Masnoo' under Istisna'a should be included, regardless of the innovative nature of the development process.
Proposal 3 provides essential guidance for applying the Percentage-of-Completion (PoC) method to intangible assets. It acknowledges the differences from traditional construction and offers alternative, appropriate methods for measuring progress (output methods, surveys) alongside the input method. The guidance on achieving "reasonable accuracy" in cost estimation for intangibles is also practical and necessary. This addition helps ensure the preferred PoC method can be applied reliably to technology-based Istisna'a contracts, improving the relevance and reliability of reported financial information.
Collectively, the proposals enhance the clarity, applicability, and relevance of FAS 10 for a significant and growing class of Istisna'a contracts involving intangible assets, without fundamentally altering the core principles of the standard. They are well-structured and integrate logically with the existing standard's framework.

**Concerns:**

-  **Consistency with other AAOIFI Standards:** While the proposals improve internal consistency within FAS 10 regarding intangible assets, there is a potential need to ensure explicit consistency or provide cross-references with other AAOIFI Accounting Standards that might deal specifically with intangible assets (e.g., recognition, measurement, capitalization criteria) or general principles of revenue recognition beyond Istisna'a. This ensures a cohesive framework across all AAOIFI standards.
-  **Definition and Scope of "Development":** Proposal 2 relies on the distinction between "research" and "development." While this is a standard accounting concept, its application in rapidly evolving and iterative technology development (like agile software development) can be complex. The proposed text clarifies "directly attributable," but the absence of a definition or further criteria within the standard for what constitutes contract-specific "development" could lead to inconsistent interpretation and application in practice.

**Recommendations:**

-  **Review and Cross-reference AAOIFI Intangible Asset/Revenue Standards:** Before finalization, conduct a review across relevant AAOIFI Accounting Standards to ensure that the proposed treatment of development costs (Proposal 2) and the methods for measuring progress and estimating costs for intangible assets (Proposal 3) are consistent with or appropriately differentiated from principles in other standards related to intangible assets or general revenue recognition. Add cross-references to these standards where applicable.
-  **Consider Defining "Development":** Enhance Proposal 2 by adding a brief explanatory note or definition section that clarifies what constitutes "development activities that are directly attributable to the creation of the specific Al-Masnoo'" in the context of intangible assets. This could include criteria related to technical feasibility, intent to use/sell, and the existence of resources to complete the project, tailored for the Istisna'a context, to provide more robust guidance for distinguishing development from research.
