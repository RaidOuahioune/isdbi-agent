# Standards Enhancement Results - FAS 10

## Trigger Scenario

A financial institution wants to structure an Istisna'a contract for the development 
                              of a large-scale AI software platform. The current wording of FAS 10 on 'well-defined 
                              subject matter' and 'determination of cost' is causing uncertainty for intangible assets 
                              like software development.

#### Shariah Expert

**Analysis:**

From a Shariah perspective, the proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 are generally well-aligned with the principles of Istisna'a and aim to apply them appropriately to the context of intangible assets, specifically software development.

Proposal 1 directly addresses the fundamental Shariah requirement of specifying the subject matter (Al-Masnoo') in the Istisna'a contract to avoid *Gharar* (excessive uncertainty). The original standard's examples for Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity are tailored for tangible goods. The proposal appropriately adapts these concepts for intangibles by providing relevant examples (software platform, data model) and interpreting quality (functional requirements, performance metrics, etc.) and quantity (scope elements like features, modules) in a manner suitable for software. This adaptation is necessary and consistent with the objective of ensuring the subject matter is known and specified. The addition of sub-paragraph 4/1/1A acknowledges the practical reality of complex intangible projects where detailed specifications might evolve. This is acceptable from a Shariah standpoint, provided that the *initial* contract establishes a sufficiently clear definition of Al-Masnoo' to remove significant Gharar at the time of contracting. The emphasis on defining a clear process for managing evolving specifications within the contract is crucial for maintaining Shariah compliance by ensuring mutual agreement on any material changes, similar to how variations are handled in traditional construction Istisna'a.

Proposal 2 and 3 focus on the operational and accounting treatment for intangible Istisna'a, primarily from the perspective of Al-Sani' (the Islamic bank). Proposal 2 provides guidance on measuring progress, determining completion, and accounting for Work-in-Progress (WIP) and costs for intangibles. The proposed methods for measuring progress (milestones, module completion, cost-to-cost, deliverables) are reasonable adaptations for software development contracts. Accounting for WIP as accumulated costs and recognized profit aligns with the standard's existing framework for tangible Istisna'a. These are accounting applications that do not inherently violate Shariah principles, provided the underlying contract is valid. Proposal 3 clarifies the treatment of costs, specifically addressing the distinction between general R&D (excluded) and specific, contract-required development costs integral to the contracted intangible asset (included as direct costs). This distinction is logical and aligns with accurately costing the specific Al-Masnoo' being manufactured under the contract. The acknowledgment of difficulty in cost estimation for complex intangibles and the reinforcement of using the completed contract method when reasonable accuracy is not achievable is prudent accounting practice and indirectly supports the Shariah principle of avoiding recognition based on excessive uncertainty.

Overall, the proposals demonstrate an understanding of the challenges in applying traditional Istisna'a frameworks to modern intangible assets and offer practical solutions aimed at maintaining both Shariah compliance (by addressing Gharar in specification) and sound financial reporting.

**Concerns:**

-  **Potential Ambiguity in "Evolving Specifications" (Proposal 1, 4/1/1A):** While acknowledging the iterative nature of intangible development is practical, the phrase "certain detailed specifications... may evolve" could be misinterpreted to allow contracts where the initial definition of Al-Masnoo' is fundamentally vague, with critical details left to be determined during the development process. This could lead to excessive Gharar at the time of contracting, potentially invalidating the contract under Shariah, as Al-Masnoo' must be known and specified *to the extent of removing any lack of knowledge* at the outset. The risk is that the "evolution" clause could undermine the foundational requirement of initial clarity.

**Recommendations:**

-  Refine the wording in the new sub-paragraph 4/1/1A (Proposal 1) to explicitly state that the *initial* contract specifications must provide a clear and sufficient definition of Al-Masnoo' (covering Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity) to remove significant Gharar at the time of contracting. Emphasize that the "evolution" process pertains to the refinement of details or agreed-upon variations within the framework of the clearly defined initial scope and quality parameters, rather than the definition of the core subject matter itself.
-  Add further guidance (perhaps in the Rationale or Basis for Conclusions for 4/1/1A) on what constitutes "sufficiently detailed" initial specifications for intangible assets like software development (e.g., defining core functionalities, architectural principles, primary performance targets, key features) and clarify that the change management procedures must require mutual agreement for any significant alterations to scope, cost, or timeline that deviate from the initial framework.

#### Finance Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 are a necessary and welcome step towards addressing the application of Istisna'a contracts to intangible assets, such as software development and AI platforms. The current standard, as evidenced by the retrieved excerpts which focus on tangible goods and construction-like examples, lacks specific guidance for the unique characteristics of intangibles.

Proposal 1 directly addresses the foundational requirement of specifying Al-Masnoo' (the subject matter). By adding examples and clarifying the interpretation of Kind, Type, Quality, and Quantity for intangibles, it provides much-needed clarity for contract drafting. The new sub-paragraph 4/1/1A is particularly important from an accounting perspective as it acknowledges the potentially iterative nature of complex intangible development. This recognition of evolving specifications within a defined framework is crucial for determining when a valid contract exists and when performance obligations are sufficiently defined for recognition purposes. Without adequate specification, it would be challenging to determine what costs are attributable to the contract or measure progress reliably.

Proposal 2 provides essential guidance for operationalizing and accounting for intangible Istisna'a. This is where the direct financial accounting and reporting implications are most prominent.
-   **Progress Measurement:** Suggesting methods like milestones, module completion, cost-to-cost, and deliverables provides practical approaches for applying the percentage-of-completion method (already permitted by FAS 10 as per Appendix E Basis for Conclusions). These methods are commonly used in software development and are suitable adaptations for intangible outputs. Reliable progress measurement is fundamental for accurate revenue and profit recognition over the contract term.
-   **Completion:** Defining completion based on delivery and acceptance aligns with standard revenue recognition principles and provides a clear trigger point for final accounting entries.
-   **WIP and Costs:** Clarifying the nature of direct costs for intangibles (labor, specific tools, services) is vital for accurate cost accumulation. Defining WIP for intangibles as accumulated costs and recognized profit is consistent with the concept presented for tangibles in the existing standard (e.g., Example 3 and paragraphs 5 & 6 referenced in excerpts 1 & 2) but adapted for the intangible context. This ensures that the asset under development is appropriately recognized and measured on the statement of financial position.

Proposal 3 tackles the challenging areas of cost estimation and the distinction between contract costs and R&D, which are particularly complex in innovative intangible projects.
-   **R&D Distinction:** The proposed clarification regarding the inclusion of costs for *specific, contract-required* development activities as direct costs is crucial. This acknowledges that for novel intangible outputs, the development process itself might involve activities akin to R&D but are essential deliverables of the contract, not general exploratory work. This affects the total contract cost measurement, which in turn impacts profit calculation and WIP valuation. This distinction, if applied consistently, will improve the accuracy of financial reporting for such contracts.
-   **Cost Estimation Accuracy:** Explicitly acknowledging the difficulty in estimating costs for complex intangibles and reinforcing the condition for using the completed contract method when reasonable accuracy is not achievable is a practical necessity. This directly impacts the choice of revenue recognition method and highlights a potential source of uncertainty that needs careful management and potential disclosure. This aligns with the principle in Appendix E that reliable cost estimation is a crucial condition for using the percentage-of-completion method.

Overall, the proposals demonstrate a clear understanding of the challenges in applying FAS 10 to intangibles and provide practical, relevant guidance that is consistent with the existing framework while adapting it to the nature of the subject matter. They aim to improve the reliability and relevance of financial reporting for these types of Istisna'a contracts. The current excerpts show the standard's focus on tangible examples, highlighting the need for this specific guidance for intangibles.

**Concerns:**

-  **Reliability of Estimates for Complex/Innovative Projects:** While the proposals acknowledge the difficulty in cost estimation and suggest methods for progress measurement, the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in developing truly novel or complex intangible assets (like cutting-edge AI) remain significant. Achieving "reasonable accuracy" for total contract costs and reliably measuring progress, particularly in early stages, can be extremely challenging. This could lead to material adjustments in recognized profit or losses in later periods, potentially impacting the reliability of financial statements prepared using the percentage-of-completion method.
-  **Practical Application of R&D Distinction:** Distinguishing between "specific, contract-required" research/development costs and excluded "general" R&D costs can be difficult in practice, even with clear contractual definitions. Development teams often work on multiple projects or foundational technology simultaneously. Proper allocation and justification of costs as directly attributable to a specific contract will require robust internal cost accounting systems and clear project scope management.

**Recommendations:**

-  **Enhance Disclosure Requirements:** For significant Istisna'a contracts involving complex or innovative intangible assets, require enhanced disclosures in the financial statements. These disclosures should include the method used for measuring progress (e.g., milestones, cost-to-cost), the nature of significant uncertainties in cost estimation or progress measurement, and the impact of any significant revisions to estimates during the reporting period. This would provide users of financial statements with better insight into the risks and judgments associated with these contracts.
-  **Develop Illustrative Examples:** Include detailed illustrative examples (perhaps as part of the proposed Appendix G or a separate implementation guidance document) demonstrating: *   How to apply the specification criteria (Kind, Type, Quality, Quantity) to different types of intangibles (e.g., custom software vs. an AI model). *   How to measure progress using different methods (milestones, cost-to-cost) for an intangible development project. *   How to distinguish and account for costs related to specific, contract-required development activities versus general R&D in a practical scenario. This would significantly aid financial institutions and auditors in consistently applying the standard.

**Analysis:**

The proposed enhancements effectively address the identified gaps in AAOIFI FAS 10 regarding the application of Istisna'a principles to intangible assets, particularly complex software development.
Proposal 1 provides much-needed clarity by adding examples of intangible assets to the specification requirements in Appendix (C) and offering tailored criteria for interpreting "Kind," "Type," "Quality," and "Quantity" for such assets. The introduction of sub-paragraph 4/1/1A is crucial as it acknowledges the inherent iterative and evolving nature of complex intangible projects, aligning the standard with practical realities while maintaining the Shari'ah requirement for defining the subject matter by emphasizing the importance of contractually defined frameworks for managing specification changes. This enhances the clarity and practical applicability of the standard for modern contracts.
Proposal 2 structurally improves the standard by proposing a new Appendix (G) dedicated to the application of FAS 10 to intangible assets. This is a logical way to provide detailed guidance without disrupting the core principles or Shariah appendix. The guidance on measuring progress using methods relevant to intangibles (milestones, module completion, deliverables) and clarifying the nature of WIP for intangibles is highly relevant and addresses the operational challenges faced by institutions. It correctly links these concepts back to the existing accounting principles of FAS 10.
Proposal 3 tackles the critical issues of cost estimation and categorization for complex intangible projects. The clarification in paragraph 2/1(a) regarding the inclusion of contract-specific development costs that might resemble R&D is essential. It draws a necessary distinction based on the contractual requirement for these activities as deliverables or integral components, which is a sound basis for cost capitalization within a specific contract. The amendment to Appendix (E) correctly highlights the difficulty in cost estimation for complex intangibles and reinforces the condition for using the percentage-of-completion method, guiding users towards the completed contract method when reasonable accuracy is not feasible, consistent with the existing standard's framework.
Collectively, the proposals demonstrate a thorough understanding of the challenges posed by intangible assets in the context of Istisna'a and offer practical, well-reasoned solutions that aim to maintain consistency with the standard's underlying principles while enhancing its applicability and clarity.

**Concerns:**

-  **Distinguishing Contract-Specific Development from General R&D:** While the criterion proposed in paragraph 2/1(a) ("directly required and defined as deliverables or integral components within a specific Istisna'a contract") is conceptually sound, its practical application may still present challenges in complex, innovative projects. The line between developing novel technology *for* a specific contract and developing novel technology that *enables* the contract but also has broader future uses (which would be general R&D) can be subjective and prone to inconsistent interpretation across different institutions or projects.
-  **Subjectivity in Progress Measurement and Cost Estimation Reliability:** For complex intangible development, methods like milestone achievement or percentage of module completion (Proposal 2) and cost estimation (Proposal 3) are inherently more subjective than for tangible goods. While the standard correctly points to the completed contract method if estimates are unreliable, the initial determination of "reasonable accuracy" for applying the percentage-of-completion method relies heavily on management judgment and project management practices, potentially leading to variability in reported results.

**Recommendations:**

-  Provide further illustrative examples or detailed guidance, possibly within the new Appendix (G), to elaborate on the distinction between contract-specific development costs includible in Istisna'a costs and excludable general R&D costs, especially in the context of innovative technology development. Emphasize the importance of detailed contractual clauses that clearly define the scope and nature of development activities as deliverables.
-  Include additional guidance in Appendix (G) on criteria for evaluating the reliability of progress measurement methods and cost estimates for intangible projects. This could involve suggesting documentation requirements, validation processes, or internal control considerations to support the assertion of "reasonable accuracy" when applying the percentage-of-completion method.
