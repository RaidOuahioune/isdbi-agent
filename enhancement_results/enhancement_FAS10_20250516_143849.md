Standards Enhancement Results for FAS 10
================================================================================

Trigger Scenario:
--------------------------------------------------
A financial institution wants to structure an Istisna'a contract for the development 
                              of a large-scale AI software platform. The current wording of FAS 10 on 'well-defined 
                              subject matter' and 'determination of cost' is causing uncertainty for intangible assets 
                              like software development.

Initial Analysis:
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, acting as the Standards Reviewer Agent, I will analyze AAOIFI FAS 10 (Istisna'a) in the context of structuring an Istisna'a for a large-scale AI software platform, focusing on the challenges related to "well-defined subject matter" and "determination of cost" for intangible assets.

While I do not have the full, clause-by-clause text of FAS 10 readily available in this interface, I can analyze the *implications* of applying a standard traditionally designed for tangible manufacturing/construction to a complex intangible asset like software, based on the core principles of Istisna'a and the user's highlighted concerns.

**Standard Being Analyzed:** AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 10 - Istisna'a

**Trigger Scenario:** Structuring an Istisna'a contract for the development of a large-scale AI software platform. Concerns exist regarding applying requirements for "well-defined subject matter" and "determination of cost" to this intangible asset.

**Analysis of Potential Gaps, Ambiguities, or Areas Needing Enhancement:**

FAS 10, like the underlying Shariah concept of Istisna'a, was primarily developed and applied in contexts involving the manufacturing or construction of tangible assets (buildings, machinery, ships, etc.). Applying this framework directly to the development of complex, intangible assets like AI software presents significant challenges that highlight potential gaps or ambiguities in the standard's current wording, likely designed with tangibles in mind.

**1. Potential Gap/Ambiguity: "Well-Defined Subject Matter" (Mushna') Requirement**

*   **Standard's Likely Requirement:** FAS 10, reflecting Shariah principles, would require the subject matter of the Istisna'a (the Mushna') to be clearly and precisely defined at the time of contract execution. For tangible assets, this typically involves detailed physical specifications, dimensions, materials, quality standards, location (for construction), etc.
*   **Issue in Trigger Scenario (AI Software):** Defining a large-scale AI software platform "precisely" at the outset of a multi-year development project is inherently difficult, if not impossible, in the same way one defines a building or a machine. Software development, especially for complex AI, is often iterative. Requirements evolve based on user feedback, technological advancements, unforeseen technical challenges, and the discovery of new possibilities during development.
    *   How does "well-defined" apply to functional requirements, performance metrics, algorithms, datasets, and user experience, which are the key characteristics of software?
    *   What level of detail is required? A full, frozen functional specification document? What if agile methodologies are used, where specifications evolve?
    *   How are potential scope changes, which are common in software development, handled within the framework of a contract requiring a "well-defined" subject matter upfront? Does the standard provide guidance on how variations affect the initial definition and the accounting treatment?
*   **Why this is an issue:** Applying a strict "well-defined" requirement meant for physical objects to dynamic software development can render Istisna'a impractical for such projects or force artificial constraints on the development process. It creates uncertainty for financial institutions and developers on whether the contract truly qualifies as a valid Istisna'a under the standard and how to account for inevitable changes. The standard needs to clarify how the "well-defined" principle applies to intangible assets, perhaps allowing for definition based on detailed functional specifications, performance criteria, and a structured change management process rather than purely physical attributes.

**2. Potential Gap/Ambiguity: "Determination of Cost" and Accounting for Development Costs**

*   **Standard's Likely Requirement:** FAS 10 would outline how costs related to the Istisna'a contract are accumulated and accounted for (e.g., using the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method). This typically involves identifying direct costs (materials, labor) and attributable overhead related to the manufacturing or construction process.
*   **Issue in Trigger Scenario (AI Software):**
    *   **Cost Structure:** The cost structure of software development is vastly different from physical manufacturing. Labor (developers, data scientists, project managers) constitutes a much larger proportion of the cost compared to materials. Infrastructure (cloud computing, development tools) and potentially third-party data or model licenses are significant.
    *   **Uncertainty:** Costs in complex software development are often less predictable than in established manufacturing processes. Technical hurdles, the need for extensive R&D-like activities (especially in AI), and evolving scope can significantly impact final costs.
    *   **Intangible Asset Accounting:** Accounting for the *asset* itself (the developed software) typically follows principles for intangible assets (e.g., IAS 38). This involves distinguishing between research and development phases and applying capitalization criteria based on technical feasibility, intention to complete, ability to use/sell, probable future economic benefits, and ability to measure cost reliably. Does FAS 10's cost accounting framework for a "Mushna'" align with or conflict with these principles for capitalizing intangible software development costs?
    *   **Revenue Recognition:** The method of cost accumulation directly impacts revenue recognition under percentage-of-completion. If costs are uncertain or not clearly defined in the standard for software, applying this method becomes challenging and subjective.
*   **Why this is an issue:** The standard's guidance on cost determination, likely framed for tangible inputs and processes, may not adequately address the unique cost structure and uncertainties of software development. It creates ambiguity on how to accumulate and classify software development costs within the Istisna'a framework and how these costs relate to the eventual recognition of the AI platform as an intangible asset on the balance sheet. Guidance is needed on how to apply cost accounting principles within FAS 10 to intangible development, potentially integrating with or referencing established intangible asset accounting standards, and addressing cost estimation challenges specific to software/AI.

**Overall Need for Enhancement:**

FAS 10 requires significant enhancement to explicitly address the application of Istisna'a to intangible assets, particularly complex ones like software. The enhancements should provide:

1.  **Clear definitions and guidance** on how the "well-defined subject matter" requirement applies to intangible assets, focusing on functional, performance, and technical specifications rather than physical attributes.
2.  **Specific guidance** on accumulating and accounting for software development costs within the Istisna'a framework, considering the predominance of labor, infrastructure, and potentially R&D-like elements.
3.  **Clarification** on how the cost accounting under FAS 10 interacts with or incorporates principles for capitalizing intangible asset development costs.
4.  **Guidance** on handling scope changes and variations in intangible Istisna'a contracts.

Without these enhancements, financial institutions face significant uncertainty and potential non-compliance or misapplication of the standard when attempting to structure Istisna'a for modern intangible assets, limiting the use of this Shariah-compliant structure in the technology sector.

Enhancement Proposal:
--------------------------------------------------
Okay, acting as the Standards Enhancement Proposer Agent, I will draft specific text changes to AAOIFI FAS 10 based on the reviewer's analysis regarding the application to intangible assets like software.

Since the full text of FAS 10 is not provided, I will propose additions and modifications to hypothetical sections that would typically cover the definition of the subject matter and the accounting for contract costs in an Istisna'a standard.

---

**Enhancement Proposal 1: Clarifying "Well-Defined Subject Matter" for Intangible Assets**

*   **Area Addressed:** Definition and description of the subject matter (Mushna').
*   **Identified Issue:** The standard's requirement for a "well-defined subject matter," likely framed for tangible assets, is ambiguous and difficult to apply to dynamic, intangible assets like software development, which involves evolving functional, technical, and performance specifications.

*   **Hypothetical Original Text (Reflecting likely focus on tangibles):**
    *   *[Section X - Definition of Mushna']*
        *   "The subject matter of the Istisna'a contract (the Mushna') must be clearly and precisely defined at the time of contract execution. The definition shall include sufficient detail regarding specifications, dimensions, materials, quality standards, and any other relevant characteristics necessary for its construction or manufacturing."

*   **Proposed Modified Text:**
    *   *[Section X - Definition of Mushna']*
        *   "The subject matter of the Istisna'a contract (the Mushna') must be clearly and precisely defined at the time of contract execution. The definition shall include sufficient detail regarding specifications, dimensions, materials, quality standards, and any other relevant characteristics necessary for its construction or manufacturing.
        *   **X.1 Application to Intangible Assets:** When the subject matter is an intangible asset, such as software, this requirement is met by defining the asset based on its essential functional requirements, technical specifications, performance criteria, and intended use. While the final detailed design or implementation specifics may evolve during the development process, the core capabilities, system architecture principles, key features, and acceptance criteria must be sufficiently described to establish a clear understanding of the asset being developed. For complex or long-term intangible development projects, the definition may be structured in phases or modules, provided the overall scope and objectives are clearly delineated. Changes to the defined subject matter shall be handled in accordance with the provisions on contract variations (see Section Y)."

*   **Rationale:**
    *   This proposed text explicitly addresses the application of the "well-defined" principle to intangible assets.
    *   It shifts the focus from physical attributes (dimensions, materials) to relevant characteristics for intangibles (functional requirements, technical specs, performance criteria).
    *   It acknowledges the iterative nature of software development by allowing for the evolution of *detailed design* while requiring the *core capabilities and scope* to be defined upfront.
    *   It provides flexibility for defining complex projects in phases while ensuring overall clarity.
    *   It cross-references handling variations, addressing a related concern from the analysis.
    *   This clarification makes the standard applicable and practical for structuring Istisna'a contracts for technology development, reducing uncertainty for financial institutions and developers.

---

**Enhancement Proposal 2: Guidance on "Determination of Cost" for Intangible Development**

*   **Area Addressed:** Accounting for Istisna'a contract costs.
*   **Identified Issue:** The standard's guidance on cost determination, likely focused on manufacturing/construction, does not adequately address the unique cost structure of software development (predominance of labor, infrastructure, etc.) and the inherent uncertainties.

*   **Hypothetical Original Text (Reflecting likely focus on tangibles):**
    *   *[Section Z - Accounting for Istisna'a Contracts]*
        *   "Costs incurred on Istisna'a contracts shall include all costs that relate directly to the specific contract and costs that are attributable to contract activity in general and can be allocated to the contract. Direct costs typically include raw materials, direct labor, and direct expenses. Attributable costs may include production overheads."

*   **Proposed Modified Text:**
    *   *[Section Z - Accounting for Istisna'a Contracts]*
        *   "Costs incurred on Istisna'a contracts shall include all costs that relate directly to the specific contract and costs that are attributable to contract activity in general and can be allocated to the contract. Direct costs typically include raw materials, direct labor, and direct expenses. Attributable costs may include production overheads.
        *   **Z.1 Determination of Costs for Intangible Assets:** When the subject matter is an intangible asset, contract costs shall include costs directly attributable to the development activities. These typically include, but are not limited to:
            *   Costs of direct labor (e.g., developers, engineers, designers, project managers) directly engaged in the development of the Mushna'.
            *   Costs of materials and services consumed in the development process (e.g., software licenses used in development, data acquisition costs directly related to the Mushna').
            *   Costs of using infrastructure directly required for the development (e.g., cloud computing resources, specialized hardware).
            *   Indirect costs and overheads attributable to the development activity, allocated on a systematic and rational basis.
        *   Costs that do not directly contribute to creating the defined Mushna', such as general administrative overhead or costs related to marketing activities, shall be excluded."

*   **Rationale:**
    *   This proposal explicitly lists cost categories relevant to software development (labor, infrastructure, licenses), which are often the primary cost drivers for intangible assets.
    *   It clarifies that these costs are considered "direct" or "attributable" within the Istisna'a framework when related to the development of the specific Mushna'.
    *   It maintains consistency with the general principle of including direct and attributable costs while adapting it to the intangible context.
    *   This provides necessary guidance for financial institutions and developers on how to accumulate costs for software development Istisna'a, improving the reliability of cost measurement required for accounting methods like percentage-of-completion.

---

**Enhancement Proposal 3: Interaction with Intangible Asset Accounting Principles**

*   **Area Addressed:** Recognition of the completed asset and its relationship with cost accumulation.
*   **Identified Issue:** The analysis highlighted the potential conflict or lack of clarity on how FAS 10's cost accounting interacts with principles for capitalizing intangible assets (like those found in AAOIFI FAS 25, which aligns with IAS 38 principles regarding R&D, capitalization criteria, etc.).

*   **Hypothetical Original Text (Standard is silent on this specific interaction):**
    *   *[Standard focuses on contract accounting (revenue/cost recognition over time or upon completion) but does not explicitly link this to the subsequent accounting for the completed asset as an intangible.]*

*   **Proposed Modified Text:**
    *   *[Add a new section or clause, potentially within the section on accounting for the completed contract or asset recognition]:*
        *   **Z.2 Relationship with Intangible Asset Accounting:** Upon completion and delivery of an intangible asset developed under an Istisna'a contract, the accumulated contract costs recognized in accordance with this Standard represent the cost of the acquired intangible asset from the perspective of the customer/buyer. The accounting for the completed intangible asset on the balance sheet of the customer/buyer, including its initial recognition, subsequent measurement, and amortization, shall be in accordance with relevant AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standards applicable to intangible assets (e.g., FAS 25 Intangible Assets), considering the nature of the asset and the customer's intended use. For the contractor, costs accumulated and revenue recognized under this Standard represent the cost of fulfilling the contract and the revenue earned, which would contribute to the determination of profit or loss on the contract. The contractor's accounting for any internally developed components or know-how not specific to the contract, or for costs incurred in research phases, shall also comply with relevant accounting standards for intangible assets.

*   **Rationale:**
    *   This proposal explicitly addresses the link between the cost accumulation under FAS 10 and the subsequent accounting for the resulting intangible asset.
    *   It clarifies that the contract costs determined under FAS 10 form the basis for the initial cost of the intangible asset for the *customer*.
    *   It mandates compliance with relevant AAOIFI standards for intangible assets (like FAS 25) for subsequent accounting (amortization, impairment) by the customer.
    *   It also clarifies the contractor's perspective on the accumulated costs and revenue.
    *   By referencing standards like FAS 25, it implicitly acknowledges the need to consider principles like distinguishing research from development and meeting capitalization criteria, which are crucial for intangible assets, without needing to replicate those detailed rules within FAS 10 itself. This promotes consistency across AAOIFI standards.

---

**Enhancement Proposal 4: Handling Scope Changes and Variations**

*   **Area Addressed:** Contract variations and modifications.
*   **Identified Issue:** Software development often involves scope changes. The standard, likely focused on fixed-scope tangible projects, needs guidance on how to handle and account for these variations in the context of an intangible Istisna'a.

*   **Hypothetical Original Text (May have general clauses on contract modifications):**
    *   *[Section Y - Contract Variations, Claims, and Incentives]*
        *   "Variations to the contract may occur during the course of the contract. The accounting treatment of variations depends on whether they are agreed with the customer and result in changes to the contract price and scope."

*   **Proposed Modified Text:**
    *   *[Section Y - Contract Variations, Claims, and Incentives]*
        *   "Variations to the contract may occur during the course of the contract. The accounting treatment of variations depends on whether they are agreed with the customer and result in changes to the contract price and scope.
        *   **Y.1 Variations in Intangible Asset Development:** Given the iterative nature of developing complex intangible assets like software, variations to the initially defined subject matter (Mushna') are common. Material changes in scope, functionality, technical specifications, or performance criteria shall be formally agreed upon by both parties through a documented contract amendment.
        *   The impact of such variations on the estimated total contract cost and estimated total contract revenue shall be assessed and adjusted prospectively from the date the variation is agreed. If a variation significantly alters the nature of the asset being developed or constitutes a separate, distinct development effort, it may need to be accounted for as a new, separate Istisna'a contract, provided it meets the criteria for contract segmentation."

*   **Rationale:**
    *   This proposal explicitly acknowledges that variations are common in intangible development.
    *   It requires formal documentation (contract amendment) for material changes, ensuring proper governance.
    *   It mandates the prospective adjustment of cost and revenue estimates, aligning with standard contract accounting practices for variations.
    *   It introduces the concept of potentially treating a significant variation as a separate contract if it fundamentally changes the scope, providing a framework for complex projects where the subject matter might evolve substantially.
    *   This provides necessary clarity and structure for managing and accounting for the inevitable changes in software development projects structured as Istisna'a.

These proposed enhancements aim to make AAOIFI FAS 10 more robust and applicable to modern financial transactions involving the development of intangible assets, specifically addressing the challenges identified in the review analysis regarding "well-defined subject matter" and "determination of cost" in the context of AI software development. They maintain the core principles of Istisna'a while providing necessary adaptations for the unique characteristics of intangible assets.

Discussion History:
--------------------------------------------------

Round 1 - shariah:
Analysis: The proposal seeks to adapt AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 10, which governs Istisna'a contracts, to the specific context of intangible assets, particularly software development. The core objective is to make the standard practical and applicable for structuring and accounting for such projects within an Islamic finance framework. The proposed enhancements address key challenges identified when applying a standard primarily designed for tangible manufacturing or construction to the unique characteristics of intangibles.
From a Shariah perspective, the Istisna'a contract is a valid form of contract for manufacturing or constructing a specified subject matter (Mushna'). The validity of Istisna'a is contingent on several conditions, most importantly that the Mushna' is well-defined and specified at the time of contract execution to avoid Gharar (excessive uncertainty). The proposed enhancements aim to address how these fundamental principles, particularly the requirement for a "well-defined subject matter," can be interpreted and applied in the context of intangible assets like software, where physical attributes are irrelevant and specifications may evolve.
Enhancement Proposal 1 directly tackles the "well-defined subject matter" issue. It proposes adapting the definition from physical characteristics to functional, technical, and performance specifications relevant to intangibles. This adaptation seems consistent with the underlying Shariah objective of removing ambiguity about the subject matter, provided the described specifications are genuinely clear enough to define the asset being developed. Acknowledging the evolution of *detailed design* while requiring the *core capabilities* to be defined upfront is a practical approach for software development and appears permissible under Shariah, as long as the initial core definition is sufficiently precise to form the basis of a binding contract.
Enhancement Proposal 2 focuses on the accounting for contract costs. This is primarily an accounting methodology issue rather than a Shariah validity issue of the contract itself. Listing typical cost categories for software development (labor, infrastructure, licenses) provides useful guidance for applying cost accounting principles within the Istisna'a framework to this specific asset type. These costs are legitimate expenditures in developing software and their recognition for accounting purposes does not conflict with Shariah principles.
Enhancement Proposal 3 clarifies the interaction between FAS 10's cost accounting and the subsequent accounting for the completed intangible asset under standards like FAS 25. This is also primarily an accounting and financial reporting matter aimed at ensuring consistency across AAOIFI standards. It correctly identifies that the accumulated Istisna'a costs form the basis for the customer's initial cost of the intangible asset. This interaction does not raise direct Shariah concerns regarding the contract's validity but is crucial for accurate financial representation of the transaction's outcome.
Enhancement Proposal 4 addresses contract variations and scope changes, which are common in software development. Shariah allows parties to a binding contract (like Istisna'a) to mutually agree on modifications. The proposal's requirement for formal agreement on material changes and prospective adjustment of costs/revenue aligns with the Shariah principle of mutual consent in contract amendments. Providing guidance on how to handle variations is essential for practical application and does not conflict with Shariah.
Overall, the proposed enhancements appear to be a sensible and necessary adaptation of the Istisna'a standard to accommodate intangible assets. They aim to apply the spirit of Shariah principles (like defining the subject matter to avoid Gharar) to a new asset class, while providing practical accounting guidance.
Concerns:
-  **Practical Sufficiency of Intangible Definition:** While Proposal 1 adapts the definition of the Mushna', the practical challenge lies in ensuring that defining "core capabilities, system architecture principles, key features, and acceptance criteria" is truly sufficient to remove excessive uncertainty (Gharar) at the outset for complex or novel software projects. Vague initial specifications, even if covering "core" elements, could lead to significant disputes or fundamental scope changes that undermine the initial contract basis. The standard needs to provide more robust guidance or criteria on what constitutes a "sufficient" definition for various types of intangible assets to prevent ambiguity that could invalidate the contract from a Shariah perspective due to Gharar.
-  **Treatment of Research/Exploratory Costs:** Shariah requires the Mushna' in Istisna'a to be something that can be manufactured or constructed based on known specifications. Software development often includes phases that are exploratory or akin to research, where the feasibility or specific outcome is uncertain. Costs incurred during such phases may not strictly relate to the development of a *specified* Mushna' as required by Shariah. While Proposal 2 lists cost categories, it doesn't explicitly guide on excluding costs related to pure research or highly uncertain exploratory work that doesn't directly contribute to the defined Mushna', potentially blurring the line between permissible Istisna'a costs and non-attributable expenditures from a Shariah perspective.
-  **Linkage to FAS 25 Capitalization Criteria:** Proposal 3 correctly references FAS 25, which includes criteria for capitalizing internally generated intangible assets (distinguishing research from development, demonstrating technical feasibility, intention/ability to complete, etc.). While the proposal states that Istisna'a costs represent the cost for the customer, it doesn't explicitly state that these costs should *only* include expenditures that would meet the development capitalization criteria analogous to FAS 25 from the contractor's perspective of creating the specified asset. This link is important to ensure that costs accumulated under Istisna'a are genuinely for the *development* of the specified Mushna', aligning with the nature of the contract.
Recommendations:
-  **Enhance Guidance on Intangible Mushna' Definition:** Strengthen Proposal 1 by adding more detailed guidance or illustrative examples in the standard or accompanying implementation notes on what constitutes a "sufficiently described" intangible asset (like software) for Istisna'a purposes. This guidance should help parties assess the level of detail required for different project complexities to minimize Gharar and ensure the Mushna' is genuinely specified at contract inception. Emphasize that the definition must be clear enough to avoid fundamental disputes about the nature or core functionality of the asset.
-  **Clarify Exclusion of Research/Exploratory Costs:** Amend Proposal 2 to explicitly state that costs incurred in phases of intangible development that are purely exploratory or akin to research, where the existence or specific form of the outcome (the Mushna') is highly uncertain, should not be included as direct or attributable costs of the Istisna'a contract. These costs do not relate to the manufacturing/construction of a *specified* asset as required by Shariah for Istisna'a.
-  **Strengthen Linkage to Development Criteria:** In Proposal 3, explicitly state that the costs accumulated under the Istisna'a contract framework (Proposal 2) should, from the contractor's perspective of building the specified Mushna', correspond to costs that would meet the criteria for capitalization of an internally generated intangible asset, excluding costs akin to research. This ensures that the costs recognized under Istisna'a relate to the *development* of the specified asset, aligning with the nature of the contract.
-  **Shariah Board Review:** Ensure that the proposed amendments, particularly those related to defining the subject matter and the types of costs included, are formally reviewed and approved by the AAOIFI Shariah Board to confirm their full compliance with the underlying Shariah principles of Istisna'a when applied to intangible assets.

Round 1 - finance:
Analysis: The proposal presents a well-considered approach to adapting AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 10 on Istisna'a to the specific characteristics of intangible assets, particularly software development. It correctly identifies the key challenges posed by applying a standard likely drafted with tangible assets in mind to dynamic and intangible outputs. The proposed enhancements address critical areas: defining the subject matter, identifying relevant costs, clarifying the link to subsequent intangible asset accounting, and managing common variations.
1.  **Clarifying "Well-Defined Subject Matter" (Enhancement 1):** This proposal directly tackles a fundamental challenge. Sharia requirements for Istisna'a necessitate a clearly defined subject matter (Mushna') at contract inception. For tangible assets, this is straightforward (dimensions, materials, etc.). For software, the proposed shift in focus to functional requirements, technical specifications, performance criteria, and intended use is appropriate and aligns with how software development contracts are typically structured. Acknowledging the iterative nature and allowing for phased definition within an overall scope is pragmatic and necessary for applying Istisna'a to complex software projects while maintaining the core principle of knowing what is being developed. The cross-reference to variations is logical.
2.  **Guidance on "Determination of Cost" (Enhancement 2):** Cost accumulation is vital for Istisna'a accounting, especially for methods like percentage-of-completion. The proposed text provides valuable clarity by listing cost categories highly relevant to software development (labor, development licenses, infrastructure). This adaptation is consistent with the general principle of including direct and attributable costs but makes it practical for intangible assets where raw materials are not the primary cost driver. Explicitly excluding unrelated costs like general administration is also crucial for accurate cost measurement.
3.  **Interaction with Intangible Asset Accounting Principles (Enhancement 3):** This is a critical clarification. An Istisna'a contract for an intangible asset results in the customer acquiring an intangible asset. This proposal correctly establishes the link between the cost accumulated under FAS 10 (the contract cost) and the initial cost of the resulting intangible asset for the customer. Mandating compliance with relevant AAOIFI standards like FAS 25 (Intangible Assets) for subsequent accounting (amortization, impairment) ensures consistency across the AAOIFI framework and leverages existing principles for intangible assets. Clarifying the contractor's perspective on costs and revenue is also helpful.
4.  **Handling Scope Changes and Variations (Enhancement 4):** Software development projects are rarely static. The proposal acknowledges the commonality of variations and provides a framework for handling them. Requiring formal agreement for material changes promotes good governance and Sharia compliance (as changes to the contract terms require mutual consent). Prospective adjustment of cost and revenue estimates aligns with standard contract accounting principles. The introduction of the concept of treating a significant variation as a separate contract, potentially based on segmentation criteria, provides a necessary mechanism for dealing with fundamental scope shifts.
Overall, the proposed enhancements demonstrate a strong understanding of both Istisna'a principles and the practicalities of intangible asset development. They aim to make FAS 10 a viable and robust standard for IFIs engaging in financing or developing technology assets under this contract structure, which is increasingly relevant in the digital economy. The proposals maintain the integrity of the Istisna'a contract while providing the necessary flexibility and clarity for intangible assets.
Concerns:
-  **Subjectivity in Definitions:** While the proposals provide better criteria for defining intangible assets and handling variations, terms like "sufficient detail," "material changes," "significantly alters the nature," and "systematic and rational basis" for allocation still carry a degree of subjectivity. This could lead to inconsistencies in application across different IFIs or projects.
-  **Integration with Existing Standard Structure:** The proposal assumes hypothetical sections (X, Y, Z). The actual integration of the proposed text into the existing structure of AAOIFI FAS 10 needs careful consideration to ensure logical flow and avoid conflicts with other paragraphs within the standard.
-  **Practical Application of "Separate Contract" Criteria:** The suggestion in Enhancement 4 to treat significant variations as potentially separate contracts needs clear criteria or linkage to existing AAOIFI principles for contract segmentation to ensure consistent application and avoid arbitrary decisions.
-  **Sharia Endorsement of Adaptations:** While the adaptations seem consistent with the spirit of Istisna'a, formal Sharia endorsement of these specific adaptations for intangible assets (especially the definition criteria and handling of variations) within the standard or accompanying Sharia pronouncements is crucial for AAOIFI standards.
Recommendations:
-  **Provide Illustrative Examples:** To reduce subjectivity, AAOIFI should consider including illustrative examples within or alongside the standard. Examples could demonstrate:
-  **Develop Implementation Guidance:** Supplementary implementation guidance could provide more detailed explanations and scenarios for applying the standard to intangible assets, particularly regarding cost allocation methodologies and criteria for assessing significant variations.
-  **Refine Language and Link to Segmentation Principles:** Clarify the criteria for treating a variation as a separate contract, potentially by explicitly referencing or adapting principles similar to those for contract segmentation found in other relevant accounting standards (e.g., IFRS 15/ASC 606 principles on contract modifications, if deemed consistent with Sharia and AAOIFI framework).
-  **Ensure Sharia Review and Endorsement:** As with all AAOIFI standards, the proposed changes and their underlying rationale for application to intangible assets should undergo rigorous review by AAOIFI's Sharia Board to ensure full compliance and provide explicit Sharia endorsement for these specific adaptations.

Round 1 - standards:
Analysis: The proposal presents a well-structured approach to adapting AAOIFI FAS 10, which is primarily designed for tangible assets like construction or manufacturing, to the unique characteristics of intangible assets, specifically software development. The four proposed enhancements directly address key challenges identified in applying a standard focused on physical attributes and manufacturing processes to dynamic, intangible development projects:
1.  **Clarifying "Well-Defined Subject Matter":** This is crucial as Istisna'a fundamentally requires the subject matter (Mushna') to be clearly defined upfront to manage Gharar (uncertainty). The proposal's shift from physical descriptions to functional, technical, and performance criteria is appropriate and necessary for intangibles. Acknowledging the iterative nature while requiring definition of core scope provides practical flexibility.
2.  **Guidance on "Determination of Cost":** Cost accumulation is central to contract accounting methods (like percentage-of-completion, if applicable under FAS 10). Providing a non-exhaustive list of cost categories typical for software development (labor, infrastructure, licenses) is highly valuable for practical application and ensures consistency in identifying attributable costs within this context.
3.  **Interaction with Intangible Asset Accounting:** This proposal correctly identifies the critical link between contract accounting (FAS 10) and asset accounting (FAS 25 Intangible Assets). Clarifying that costs accumulated under FAS 10 form the basis for the customer's initial asset cost and that subsequent accounting must follow FAS 25 is essential for ensuring consistency across AAOIFI standards and providing a complete accounting picture.
4.  **Handling Scope Changes:** Software development projects are highly susceptible to scope changes. Providing specific guidance on formalizing variations, adjusting estimates prospectively, and potentially treating significant changes as separate contracts aligns FAS 10 with common project management and accounting practices for complex, long-term contracts, adapted for the intangible context.
Overall, the proposals demonstrate a sound understanding of both FAS 10's requirements and the practicalities of intangible asset development. They aim to maintain the core principles of Istisna'a while providing necessary adaptations to make the standard applicable and practical for modern technology financing structures.
Concerns:
-  **Interaction with FAS 25 Capitalization Criteria (Customer Perspective):** The proposed text in Z.2 states that accumulated FAS 10 costs "represent the cost of the acquired intangible asset". This wording might imply that all costs accumulated under the Istisna'a contract for the customer are automatically capitalizable as an intangible asset. However, AAOIFI FAS 25 (Intangible Assets, likely drawing from IAS 38 principles) requires specific criteria to be met for development costs to be capitalized (e.g., technical feasibility, intention/ability to complete, probable future economic benefits, reliable measurement). If the Istisna'a structure is seen merely as a *method* of acquiring an asset and not as automatically fulfilling the *capitalization criteria*, then the customer should still be required to assess the accumulated costs against FAS 25 criteria throughout the development period. Failure to explicitly require this assessment could lead to the capitalization of costs that would otherwise be expensed as research or non-qualifying development under FAS 25, creating inconsistency.
-  **Subjectivity in Definitions:** While the proposed additions provide helpful guidance, terms like "sufficient detail" for defining the Mushna' (X.1), "material changes," "significantly alters the nature," or "separate, distinct development effort" (Y.1) still involve a degree of subjective judgment. This could lead to inconsistent application in practice without further clarification or examples.
-  **Distinguishing Project Costs vs. General R&D/Know-How (Contractor Perspective):** Although Z.2 mentions the contractor's accounting for "internally developed components or know-how not specific to the contract," the distinction between costs directly attributable to the specific Mushna' (capitalizable/accounted for under the contract) and costs related to underlying technology platforms, reusable components, or general R&D that might inform the project but aren't solely for the specific contract can be complex, especially for technology companies. Clearer guidance on this distinction from the contractor's cost accumulation perspective under FAS 10 vs. their internal R&D accounting might be beneficial.
Recommendations:
-  **Refine Interaction with FAS 25:** Modify the proposed text in Z.2 or add a separate point to clarify that while costs accumulated under FAS 10 form the basis of the potential asset cost for the customer, these costs must still meet the capitalization criteria specified in AAOIFI FAS 25 (Intangible Assets) to be recognized as an intangible asset on the customer's balance sheet. Costs accumulated under the contract that do not meet FAS 25 capitalization criteria should be expensed by the customer.
-  **Provide Implementation Guidance/Examples:** Suggest the inclusion of implementation guidance or illustrative examples within or alongside the standard to help clarify the application of subjective terms, particularly regarding the required level of detail for defining intangible Mushna' (X.1) and the criteria for assessing variations (Y.1), including examples of what constitutes a "material change" or a "separate, distinct development effort" in intangible development.
-  **Clarify Cost Distinction (Contractor):** Consider adding further clarification, perhaps in Z.1 or Z.2, regarding the contractor's accounting for costs that benefit multiple projects or contribute to general technological know-how, distinguishing them from costs directly attributable to the specific Istisna'a Mushna'. This would help ensure that only contract-specific costs are accounted for under FAS 10 for that contract.

Round 1 - practical:
Analysis: The proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 demonstrate a practical and necessary approach to adapting the standard for the unique characteristics of intangible assets, particularly software development. The proposals correctly identify key pain points in applying a standard likely designed for tangible goods – defining the subject matter, determining relevant costs, interacting with intangible asset accounting principles, and handling common variations.
Proposal 1 effectively bridges the gap in defining the "well-defined subject matter" by shifting the focus from physical attributes to functional and technical characteristics relevant to intangibles. It acknowledges the iterative nature of software while requiring core definition upfront, aligning with standard project scoping practices.
Proposal 2 provides crucial clarity on cost determination by listing typical cost categories in software development. This is highly practical and necessary for applying cost-based accounting methods within the Istisna'a framework.
Proposal 3 is essential for integrating FAS 10 with the broader AAOIFI framework, explicitly linking the contract costs to the customer's subsequent accounting for the completed intangible asset under standards like FAS 25. This promotes consistency and clarifies the accounting treatment post-completion.
Proposal 4 directly addresses the reality of scope changes in software development by requiring formal amendments and prospective adjustments. This aligns with standard contract accounting practices for variations and provides a necessary structure for managing project evolution.
Overall, the proposals are logically structured, directly address the identified issues, and align with general accounting principles and project management practices in the technology sector. They offer a solid foundation for making Istisna'a a viable and clearly accounted-for structure for financing software development.
Concerns:
-  **Subjectivity in "Sufficient Detail":** While Proposal 1 provides examples of what constitutes a definition for intangibles, the phrase "sufficiently described" remains subjective. Determining the exact level of detail required to meet the "well-defined" threshold for complex, evolving software could still be challenging and potentially lead to inconsistent application or disputes.
-  **Interaction with Capitalization Criteria (FAS 25/IAS 38 Principles):** Proposal 3 correctly references FAS 25, but it doesn't explicitly clarify *when* costs accumulated under FAS 10 by the contractor become eligible for capitalization by the customer according to the detailed criteria in FAS 25 (e.g., technical feasibility, probable future economic benefits). This interaction needs precise guidance to ensure compliance with intangible asset capitalization rules and avoid capitalizing costs that would be expensed under FAS 25 principles if incurred directly by the customer or contractor internally (e.g., research phase costs).
-  **Progress Measurement for Revenue Recognition:** While Proposal 2 helps with cost identification, applying percentage-of-completion (if used) requires reliable measurement of the *stage of completion*. Software development progress can be difficult to measure objectively and reliably upfront (compared to physical completion percentages). The standard might need more guidance on acceptable methods for measuring progress for intangible Istisna'a contracts to ensure reliable revenue recognition.
-  **Risk Allocation and Acceptance:** Software development carries inherent risks regarding successful technical completion and meeting performance criteria. While Proposal 1 mentions acceptance criteria, the standard may need to provide more explicit guidance on how risks related to technical feasibility and successful delivery of the defined functionality impact cost accumulation and revenue recognition under FAS 10, especially in cases of project failure or significant rework.
Recommendations:
-  **Refine Guidance on "Sufficient Detail":** Enhance Proposal 1 by providing examples or principles for what constitutes "sufficient detail" in the context of software development Istisna'a. Reference standard documentation practices like functional specifications, technical architecture outlines, or detailed user stories/epics as potential ways to demonstrate the required clarity in defining the Mushna'.
-  **Clarify Capitalization Timing:** Add explicit guidance in Proposal 3 (or a new sub-section) detailing how the cost accumulation under FAS 10 aligns with the capitalization criteria of FAS 25 from the customer's perspective. Clarify whether costs incurred by the contractor *for the contract* are capitalized by the customer only *after* the FAS 25 criteria for the specific project phase or overall asset are met, or if the Istisna'a structure alters this timing.
-  **Include Guidance on Progress Measurement:** If percentage-of-completion is a permitted or expected method, add guidance within the accounting section (Proposal 2 or Z) on suitable and reliable methods for measuring the stage of completion for intangible development Istisna'a contracts (e.g., achievement of defined milestones, output-based measures like completed features/modules subject to verification, input measures like labor hours with appropriate caveats and adjustments).
-  **Address Risk and Acceptance Criteria Link:** Include a brief section or clarification on the importance of clearly defined acceptance criteria and their role in determining successful completion. Provide guidance on how costs and revenue should be treated if the developed intangible asset fails to meet the defined specifications and acceptance criteria.

Round 2 - shariah:
Analysis: The proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 aim to adapt the standard, traditionally applied to the manufacturing or construction of tangible assets, to the context of intangible assets, particularly software development. From a Shariah perspective, the Istisna'a contract is a valid contract for the manufacture or construction of a specified subject matter (Mushna') that does not exist at the time of the contract. Its validity is contingent upon, among other conditions, the precise description and clear specification of the Mushna' at the time of contracting to eliminate excessive uncertainty (Gharar).
Proposal 1 directly addresses the fundamental Shariah requirement of a "well-defined subject matter" for intangible assets. By shifting the focus from physical attributes (dimensions, materials) to relevant intangible characteristics (functional requirements, technical specifications, performance criteria, intended use), the proposal endeavors to operationalize the Gharar avoidance principle for a new asset class. Acknowledging the iterative nature of software development while requiring the definition of core capabilities upfront is a practical approach that aligns with the Shariah intent, provided the initial definition is genuinely sufficient to identify the asset being developed and avoid fundamental disputes over its nature.
Proposal 2 deals with the accounting for costs incurred under the Istisna'a contract. The Shariah validity of the Istisna'a contract itself does not dictate specific accounting methodologies for cost accumulation, but it does imply that the costs incurred must be genuinely related to the manufacturing/construction of the specified Mushna'. Listing typical cost categories for software development (labor, infrastructure, licenses) provides practical guidance on what constitutes relevant costs in this context. These are legitimate expenditures in creating software and their inclusion for accounting purposes is not in conflict with Shariah principles, provided they are directly attributable to the specified asset.
Proposal 3 clarifies the relationship between costs accumulated under FAS 10 and the subsequent accounting for the completed intangible asset under standards like FAS 25. This is primarily an accounting and financial reporting matter aimed at ensuring consistency within the AAOIFI framework. From a Shariah standpoint, the fact that the customer acquires an intangible asset as the outcome of the Istisna'a is permissible, and the accumulated contract costs representing the basis for the asset's cost for the customer is logical from an accounting perspective. The crucial Shariah link here is ensuring that the costs accounted for under Istisna'a are indeed for the *development* of the specified asset, not for unrelated research or exploratory activities.
Proposal 4 addresses contract variations and scope changes, which are common in intangible development. Shariah permits parties to a binding contract to mutually agree on amendments or variations. The proposal's requirement for formal documentation and agreement on material changes aligns with the Shariah principle of mutual consent (Taradhi) in contractual modifications. Providing guidance on how to account for these changes (prospectively adjusting estimates) is a necessary practical adaptation and does not conflict with Shariah.
Overall, the proposed enhancements represent a necessary and largely Shariah-compliant effort to adapt the Istisna'a framework to intangible assets. They respect the core Shariah principles by attempting to define the subject matter clearly and manage variations through mutual agreement. However, the practical application of these principles to the unique nature of intangibles necessitates further clarity to ensure that the spirit of Gharar avoidance and the definition of the 'specified' Mushna' are fully upheld.
Concerns:
-  **Sufficiency of Intangible Definition and Gharar:** While Proposal 1 provides criteria for defining intangible assets, the practical challenge remains in ensuring that the description of "core capabilities, system architecture principles, key features, and acceptance criteria" is truly sufficient to eliminate excessive uncertainty (Gharar) for complex or novel software projects at the contract inception. Vague or overly high-level initial specifications, even if covering these areas, could still lead to significant ambiguity regarding the final deliverable, potentially undermining the Shariah validity of the initial contract.
-  **Exclusion of Research/Exploratory Costs:** The Shariah requirement for Istisna'a is that the Mushna' can be manufactured/constructed based on known specifications. Software development often involves phases akin to research or highly uncertain exploration where the outcome is not guaranteed or clearly specified. Proposal 2 lists cost categories but does not explicitly guide on excluding costs incurred during such pure research or highly uncertain exploratory phases that do not directly contribute to the *specified* Mushna'. Including such costs within the Istisna'a framework could misrepresent the nature of the expenditure from a Shariah perspective, as Istisna'a is for construction of a specified item, not for uncertain exploration.
-  **Alignment of Istisna'a Costs with Development Capitalization Criteria:** Proposal 3 references FAS 25, which distinguishes between research (expensed) and development (potentially capitalized if criteria are met). From a Shariah perspective, the costs accounted for under the Istisna'a contract for a specified intangible should align with expenditures for the *development* of that specified asset. The proposals need to explicitly ensure that costs accumulated under FAS 10 for the intangible Mushna' are only those that would meet the criteria for development costs analogous to FAS 25 principles, thereby excluding costs that are effectively research or pre-development exploration.
-  **Subjectivity in Application:** Terms like "sufficient detail," "material changes," "significantly alters the nature," and "systematic and rational basis" for allocation (across the proposals) inherently involve subjective judgment. Without further clarification or examples, this subjectivity could lead to inconsistent application by different parties, potentially causing disputes that could be linked back to insufficient clarity in the contract terms or accounting, which Shariah aims to avoid.
Recommendations:
-  **Enhance Guidance on Intangible Mushna' Definition:** Strengthen Proposal 1 by adding more detailed guidance or illustrative examples (possibly in implementation notes) on what constitutes a "sufficiently described" intangible asset (like software) for Istisna'a purposes. This guidance should provide practical benchmarks or criteria for the level of detail required for different project complexities to minimize Gharar and ensure the Mushna' is genuinely specified at contract inception, clear enough to avoid fundamental disputes about its core nature or functionality.
-  **Explicitly Exclude Research/Exploratory Costs:** Amend Proposal 2 (Z.1) to explicitly state that costs incurred during phases of intangible development that are purely exploratory or akin to research, where the existence or specific form of the outcome (the Mushna') is highly uncertain or not yet specified, shall be excluded as direct or attributable costs of the Istisna'a contract. These costs do not align with the Shariah nature of Istisna'a as a contract for manufacturing a *specified* item.
-  **Strengthen Linkage to Development Criteria for Costs:** In Proposal 3 (Z.2), clarify that the costs accumulated under the Istisna'a contract framework (Proposal 2) for the intangible Mushna' should, from the perspective of creating the specified asset, correspond to expenditures that would meet the criteria for capitalization of an internally generated intangible asset (excluding research) under AAOIFI FAS 25 principles. This ensures that the costs recognized under Istisna'a relate to the *development* of the specified asset, aligning with the Shariah nature of the contract.
-  **Ensure Shariah Board Review and Endorsement:** It is crucial that these proposed amendments, particularly those related to defining the subject matter (Proposal 1), the types of costs included/excluded (Proposal 2, Recommendation 2 & 3), and the handling of significant variations (Proposal 4, especially segmentation), are formally reviewed and approved by the AAOIFI Shariah Board to confirm their full compliance with the underlying Shariah principles of Istisna'a when applied to intangible assets. This formal endorsement is essential for the credibility and acceptance of the standard adaptations.

Round 2 - finance:
Analysis: The proposal offers a comprehensive and well-reasoned approach to adapting AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 10, which governs Istisna'a contracts, for application to intangible assets like software. From a finance perspective, the proposals address critical areas necessary for the practical and reliable financial reporting of such transactions within an Islamic finance framework.
1.  **Enhancement Proposal 1: Clarifying "Well-Defined Subject Matter" for Intangible Assets:** This proposal is fundamental. Applying a standard designed for tangible assets to intangibles requires a redefinition of the subject matter's characteristics. Shifting the focus from physical attributes (dimensions, materials) to functional requirements, technical specifications, and performance criteria is appropriate for software development. Acknowledging the iterative nature of software development and allowing for phased definition within an overall scope is pragmatic and aligns with industry practices, while attempting to preserve the core Istisna'a principle of having a defined subject matter at inception. This clarity is essential for both the customer (buyer) to know what asset they are acquiring and the contractor (developer) to understand their obligation and estimate costs reliably.
2.  **Enhancement Proposal 2: Guidance on "Determination of Cost" for Intangible Development:** Accurate cost accumulation is vital for contract accounting, particularly if the percentage-of-completion method is applied or for determining the final cost of the asset. The proposed list of cost categories relevant to software development (labor, development licenses, infrastructure) provides much-needed practical guidance. Software development costs primarily consist of human effort and related infrastructure, not raw materials. Explicitly including these elements as direct or attributable costs within the Istisna'a framework makes the standard operational for intangible projects and improves the reliability of cost measurement. The exclusion of general administrative overhead is consistent with standard cost accounting principles for specific projects.
3.  **Enhancement Proposal 3: Interaction with Intangible Asset Accounting Principles:** This proposal is crucial for ensuring consistency and completeness in financial reporting. Clarifying that the accumulated costs under the Istisna'a contract form the basis for the *customer's* initial cost of the resulting intangible asset is essential. Mandating compliance with relevant AAOIFI standards for intangible assets (like FAS 25) for subsequent accounting (e.g., amortization, impairment) correctly integrates FAS 10 with the broader AAOIFI framework. This prevents potential conflicts and leverages existing principles for accounting for intangible assets post-acquisition/completion. Clarifying the contractor's perspective on costs and revenue is also helpful for complete reporting.
4.  **Enhancement Proposal 4: Handling Scope Changes and Variations:** Contract variations are common in complex projects, especially in software development due to evolving requirements or technical discoveries. Providing specific guidance on how to handle these variations within the Istisna'a framework is highly practical. Requiring formal agreement for material changes ensures proper governance and documentation. Prospectively adjusting cost and revenue estimates for agreed variations aligns with standard contract accounting practices. The concept of potentially treating a significant variation as a separate contract provides a necessary mechanism for dealing with fundamental shifts in project scope, which is particularly relevant for dynamic intangible development.
Overall, the proposals demonstrate a strong understanding of the challenges in applying FAS 10 to intangibles and offer sensible adaptations that maintain the core structure of Istisna'a while providing necessary flexibility and clarity for financial reporting in the context of technology assets. They aim to make the standard more relevant and applicable in the digital economy, facilitating Islamic finance involvement in technology development.
Concerns:
-  **Subjectivity in Key Definitions and Assessments:** While the proposed text provides better criteria for defining intangible assets and handling variations, terms such as "sufficient detail" (for Mushna' definition), "material changes," "significantly alters the nature," and "systematic and rational basis" (for cost allocation) still involve a degree of subjective judgment. This subjectivity could lead to inconsistent application across different financial institutions and projects, potentially impacting comparability and auditability of financial statements.
-  **Alignment with FAS 25 Capitalization Criteria (Customer):** Proposal 3 states that accumulated FAS 10 costs "represent the cost of the acquired intangible asset". This phrasing might lead to an interpretation that all costs incurred under the Istisna'a contract are automatically capitalizable by the customer. However, AAOIFI FAS 25 (aligned with IAS 38 principles) requires specific criteria to be met for costs to qualify for capitalization as an intangible asset (e.g., technical feasibility, intention/ability to complete, probable future economic benefits, ability to measure cost reliably). The Istisna'a structure is primarily a method of *financing* or *acquiring* the asset's development. The standard needs to explicitly clarify that the costs accumulated under FAS 10 must *also* meet the capitalization criteria of FAS 25 from the customer's perspective throughout the development period to be recognized as an intangible asset on the balance sheet. Costs incurred by the contractor but not meeting FAS 25 criteria from the customer's viewpoint should arguably be expensed by the customer.
-  **Distinguishing Between Contract Costs and General/Research Costs (Contractor):** Proposal 2 provides cost categories, and Proposal 3 mentions the contractor's accounting for non-contract-specific know-how. However, in complex technology development, distinguishing between costs directly attributable to the *specific* defined Mushna' (accounted for under the Istisna'a contract) and costs related to underlying reusable technology platforms, general R&D, or exploratory work that might inform the project but aren't solely for the specific contract, can be challenging for the contractor. Clearer guidance is needed to ensure only costs directly related to building the *specified* Mushna' are included in the Istisna'a contract costs.
-  **Reliability of Progress Measurement for Intangibles:** If FAS 10 allows for the use of percentage-of-completion for revenue and cost recognition for Istisna'a contracts (which is common for long-term construction/manufacturing contracts), applying this method to intangible development presents challenges. Measuring the stage of completion for software development can be highly subjective and difficult to do reliably upfront compared to physical completion measures used for tangible assets. The standard might need more specific guidance on acceptable and reliable methods for measuring progress for intangible Istisna'a contracts to ensure accurate and verifiable revenue/cost recognition over time.
Recommendations:
-  **Enhance Guidance on Subjectivity:** Supplement the proposed text with implementation guidance or illustrative examples. These examples should demonstrate what level of detail in functional, technical, and performance specifications is considered "sufficiently described" for different types of software or intangible assets. Provide examples of how to assess "material changes" and what might constitute a "separate, distinct development effort" in the context of intangible variations.
-  **Strengthen Linkage to FAS 25 Capitalization Criteria:** Modify the proposed text in Z.2 or add a new sub-point to explicitly state that while costs accumulated under FAS 10 form the basis for the customer's potential asset cost, the customer must assess these costs against the capitalization criteria outlined in AAOIFI FAS 25 throughout the development period. Only costs that meet the FAS 25 criteria should be capitalized by the customer as an intangible asset; costs that do not meet these criteria should be expensed by the customer in the period incurred.
-  **Clarify Cost Allocation Principles for Contractors:** Add more detailed guidance, potentially within Z.1 or Z.2, specifically for the contractor. This guidance should help contractors distinguish between costs directly attributable to the specific Istisna'a Mushna' (accounted for under the contract) and costs related to general technological know-how, reusable components, or research phases that are not solely for the specific contract. This ensures consistency in cost accumulation by the contractor.
-  **Provide Guidance on Progress Measurement for Intangibles:** If percentage-of-completion is a permitted accounting method under FAS 10 for intangible Istisna'a, include specific guidance on reliable methods for measuring the stage of completion for such contracts. This could include guidance on using output measures (e.g., achievement of defined milestones, completion of specific modules/features subject to verification) or input measures (e.g., labor hours incurred relative to total estimated labor hours), along with necessary caveats and requirements for reliable estimation and verification.

Round 2 - standards:
Analysis: The proposal offers a well-structured and necessary set of enhancements to AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 10 to address its applicability to intangible assets, particularly software development. The current standard, likely framed with tangible assets in mind, presents significant challenges when applied to the dynamic and non-physical nature of intangibles. The proposed modifications tackle the core issues identified: defining the subject matter (Mushna'), determining relevant costs, clarifying the relationship with intangible asset accounting standards, and managing contract variations.
Proposal 1's adaptation of the "well-defined subject matter" requirement from physical attributes to functional/technical specifications is a fundamental and appropriate step for intangibles, acknowledging the iterative nature of development while requiring clarity on the core scope. This aligns the standard with how intangible development contracts are practically structured.
Proposal 2 provides valuable guidance on cost determination by listing cost categories specific to software development. This makes the standard's cost accumulation principles practical for intangible assets, where labor and infrastructure costs are predominant, rather than raw materials. Explicitly excluding general overhead is also consistent with cost accounting principles.
Proposal 3 correctly identifies the crucial link between the Istisna'a contract costs (accounted for under FAS 10) and the subsequent accounting for the completed intangible asset on the customer's balance sheet. Mandating compliance with relevant intangible asset standards like FAS 25 is essential for consistency within the AAOIFI framework and ensures that the resulting asset is accounted for based on established principles for intangibles (amortization, impairment, etc.).
Proposal 4 addresses the common occurrence of scope changes in intangible development projects. Requiring formal agreement and prospective adjustment of estimates aligns with standard contract accounting practices for variations and provides a necessary framework for managing project evolution under the Istisna'a structure. The concept of treating significant variations as separate contracts is also a relevant consideration for complex projects.
Overall, the proposals demonstrate a good understanding of both the Istisna'a contract mechanics and the unique characteristics of intangible asset development. They aim to make FAS 10 a practical and robust standard for financing and accounting for technology assets under this contract structure, which is increasingly important. However, ensuring seamless integration with existing standards, particularly FAS 25, and providing sufficient clarity to limit subjective interpretation will be key challenges in finalizing these enhancements.
Concerns:
-  **Interaction with FAS 25 Capitalization Criteria:** The proposed text in Z.2 states that accumulated FAS 10 costs "represent the cost of the acquired intangible asset" for the customer. This wording might be interpreted as implying that all costs accumulated under the Istisna'a contract are automatically capitalizable by the customer. AAOIFI FAS 25 (Intangible Assets) includes specific criteria that must be met for development costs to be capitalized (e.g., technical feasibility, intention/ability to complete, probable future economic benefits, reliable measurement). The Istisna'a contract structure facilitates the acquisition, but the nature of the expenditures must still meet the FAS 25 criteria to be recognized as an intangible asset. The current wording does not explicitly require the customer to assess the accumulated costs against FAS 25 capitalization criteria throughout the development period, potentially leading to the capitalization of costs that would otherwise be expensed (e.g., research phase costs) under FAS 25 principles.
-  **Subjectivity in Definitions and Assessments:** While the proposed additions provide helpful guidance, terms like "sufficient detail" for defining the Mushna' (X.1), "material changes," "significantly alters the nature," or "separate, distinct development effort" (Y.1), and "systematic and rational basis" for cost allocation (Z.1) still involve a degree of subjective judgment. Without further clarification or examples, this could lead to inconsistent application of the standard across different IFIs or projects.
-  **Clarity on Research vs. Development Costs (Contractor & Customer):** Although Z.2 mentions the contractor's accounting for "internally developed components or know-how not specific to the contract," the distinction between costs directly attributable to the specific Istisna'a Mushna' and costs related to underlying technology platforms, reusable components, or general R&D that might inform the project is complex. Clearer guidance on this distinction is needed, particularly from the customer's perspective regarding which costs accumulated via the Istisna'a contract qualify for capitalization under FAS 25 and which should be expensed (e.g., costs incurred during stages akin to research).
-  **Integration into Standard Structure:** The proposal uses hypothetical section numbers. The actual integration of the proposed text into the existing structure of AAOIFI FAS 10 requires careful consideration to ensure logical flow, avoid conflicts with existing paragraphs, and maintain the overall coherence of the standard.
Recommendations:
-  **Refine Interaction with FAS 25:** Modify the proposed text in Z.2 or add a separate paragraph to explicitly state that while costs accumulated under the Istisna'a contract (determined per Z.1) form the basis of the potential asset cost for the customer, these costs must still meet the capitalization criteria specified in AAOIFI FAS 25 (Intangible Assets) to be recognized as an intangible asset on the customer's balance sheet. Clarify that costs accumulated under the contract that do not meet FAS 25 capitalization criteria (e.g., those akin to research phases) should be expensed by the customer.
-  **Develop Implementation Guidance:** Recommend the development of detailed implementation guidance, perhaps as an appendix to the standard or a separate document. This guidance should include illustrative examples to help clarify the application of subjective terms, particularly regarding:
-  **Clarify Research/Development Cost Distinction:** Add text, potentially in Z.1 or Z.2, to provide clearer guidance on distinguishing costs incurred within the Istisna'a contract that are akin to research phases from those related to development phases. Emphasize that costs related to research-like activities within the contract, from the customer's perspective, do not qualify for capitalization as part of the intangible asset cost under FAS 25 principles, even if contractually incurred.
-  **Review and Integrate Carefully:** Ensure that the final proposed text is meticulously reviewed for consistency with the rest of AAOIFI FAS 10 and integrated seamlessly into its existing structure, using clear and precise language typical of financial accounting standards. The hypothetical section numbering must be replaced with actual paragraph references.

Round 2 - practical:
Analysis: The proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 represent a crucial and practical step towards making the standard applicable to intangible assets, particularly software development. Applying a standard primarily designed for tangible manufacturing and construction to dynamic, intangible projects presents significant challenges, and the proposal effectively targets the most critical areas requiring adaptation.
Enhancement Proposal 1 directly addresses the fundamental requirement for a "well-defined subject matter" (Mushna') by proposing a shift from physical attributes to functional, technical, and performance specifications relevant to intangible assets. This is highly practical and aligns with how technology development projects are scoped and defined in the industry. Acknowledging the iterative nature of software development while emphasizing the need for definition of core capabilities upfront is a pragmatic approach that balances the need for contractual clarity with project reality.
Enhancement Proposal 2 provides necessary guidance on cost determination by listing cost categories typical for software development, such as labor, infrastructure, and licenses. This is essential for practical application of cost-based accounting methods under FAS 10 (like percentage-of-completion) to intangible projects, where traditional "raw materials" are not the primary cost driver. Explicitly excluding unrelated costs is also a standard accounting practice for contract costing.
Enhancement Proposal 3 clarifies the vital interaction between the Istisna'a contract accounting under FAS 10 and the subsequent accounting for the completed intangible asset under AAOIFI FAS 25 (Intangible Assets). This linkage is crucial for ensuring consistency within the AAOIFI framework and providing clear guidance on how the accumulated contract costs translate into the initial cost of the asset for the customer.
Enhancement Proposal 4 tackles the common occurrence of scope changes and variations in software development. Providing a framework for formalizing amendments and adjusting estimates prospectively aligns with standard project management and contract accounting practices. The possibility of treating significant variations as separate contracts offers flexibility for managing complex project evolution.
Overall, the proposals are logical, directly address the identified practical challenges, and provide a solid foundation for applying Istisna'a to technology development. They aim to maintain the core principles of the contract type while adapting the practical requirements for a different asset class.
Concerns:
-  **Subjectivity in Definitions and Assessments:** While the proposals introduce relevant concepts for intangible assets, terms like "sufficient detail" for defining the Mushna' (Proposal 1), "material changes," "significantly alters the nature," and "separate, distinct development effort" for variations (Proposal 4), and "systematic and rational basis" for cost allocation (Proposal 2) still involve a degree of subjective judgment. This subjectivity can lead to inconsistent application in practice across different financial institutions and projects.
-  **Clarity on Interaction with FAS 25 Capitalization Criteria:** Proposal 3 states that accumulated FAS 10 costs "represent the cost" for the customer. However, it needs more explicit guidance on *how* this aligns with the detailed capitalization criteria in AAOIFI FAS 25 (which are likely similar to IAS 38), particularly from the customer's perspective. It's unclear if the Istisna'a structure automatically means all contract costs are capitalizable by the customer, or if the customer must still assess these costs against FAS 25 criteria throughout the development period (e.g., distinguishing research-like phases from development phases that meet capitalization criteria). This lack of clarity poses a practical implementation challenge for the customer's accounting.
-  **Reliability of Progress Measurement for Intangibles:** If percentage-of-completion is used as the revenue/cost recognition method under FAS 10, reliably measuring the stage of completion for intangible development can be practically difficult compared to tangible assets. The standard lacks specific guidance on acceptable and reliable methods for measuring progress in software development Istisna'a contracts.
-  **Accounting for Risk, Acceptance, and Project Failure:** Software development carries inherent technical and functional risks. The proposal mentions acceptance criteria, but there is limited guidance on the practical accounting implications if the developed intangible asset fails to meet the defined specifications, is not accepted by the customer, or the project is abandoned. How are accumulated costs and recognized revenue treated in such scenarios?
Recommendations:
-  **Develop Detailed Implementation Guidance and Examples:** To mitigate the subjectivity concern, AAOIFI should supplement the standard with comprehensive implementation guidance and illustrative examples. These examples should demonstrate what constitutes "sufficient detail" for defining various types of intangible Mushna' (e.g., referencing common documentation like functional specifications, technical architectures), illustrate how to assess the materiality of variations, and provide criteria for determining when a change constitutes a "separate, distinct development effort."
-  **Provide Explicit Guidance on FAS 25 Capitalization Linkage:** Enhance Proposal 3 (or add a new section) to provide clear, step-by-step guidance on how the cost accumulation under FAS 10 interacts with the application of AAOIFI FAS 25 capitalization criteria from the customer's perspective. Clarify whether costs incurred by the contractor *for the contract* are capitalized by the customer only *after* the FAS 25 criteria for the specific project phase or overall asset are met, or if the Istisna'a structure alters this timing and assessment.
-  **Include Guidance on Progress Measurement for Intangibles:** If percentage-of-completion is a permitted method, add specific guidance within the accounting section on practical and reliable methods for measuring the stage of completion for intangible development Istisna'a contracts. This could include guidance on using milestones (subject to verification), output-based measures (e.g., completed and tested features/modules), or input measures (like labor hours, with appropriate caveats).
-  **Address Accounting for Risk, Acceptance, and Failure:** Add a section or clarification within the accounting guidance on how to treat costs accumulated and revenue recognized if the developed intangible asset fails to meet acceptance criteria, the project encounters significant technical hurdles leading to rework, or the project is ultimately unsuccessful or abandoned. This is crucial for practical risk management and accurate financial reporting.

Round 3 - shariah:
Analysis: The proposal seeks to adapt AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 10, which governs Istisna'a contracts, to the specific context of intangible assets, particularly software development. The core objective is to make the standard practical and applicable for structuring and accounting for such projects within an Islamic finance framework. The proposed enhancements address key challenges identified when applying a standard primarily designed for tangible manufacturing or construction to the unique characteristics of intangibles.
From a Shariah perspective, the Istisna'a contract is a valid form of contract for manufacturing or constructing a specified subject matter (Mushna') which does not exist at the time of contracting. The validity of Istisna'a is contingent on several conditions, most importantly that the Mushna' is well-defined and specified at the time of contract execution to avoid Gharar (excessive uncertainty). The proposed enhancements aim to address how these fundamental principles, particularly the requirement for a "well-defined subject matter," can be interpreted and applied in the context of intangible assets like software, where physical attributes are irrelevant and specifications may evolve.
Enhancement Proposal 1 directly tackles the "well-defined subject matter" issue. It proposes adapting the definition from physical characteristics to functional, technical, and performance specifications relevant to intangibles. This adaptation seems consistent with the underlying Shariah objective of removing ambiguity about the subject matter, provided the described specifications are genuinely clear enough to define the asset being developed. Acknowledging the evolution of *detailed design* while requiring the *core capabilities* to be defined upfront is a practical approach for software development and appears permissible under Shariah, as long as the initial core definition is sufficiently precise to form the basis of a binding contract and avoid excessive Gharar.
Enhancement Proposal 2 focuses on the accounting for contract costs. This is primarily an accounting methodology issue rather than a Shariah validity issue of the contract itself. Listing typical cost categories for software development (labor, infrastructure, licenses) provides useful guidance for applying cost accounting principles within the Istisna'a framework to this specific asset type. These costs are legitimate expenditures in developing software and their recognition for accounting purposes does not conflict with Shariah principles, provided they are directly attributable to the specified Mushna'.
Enhancement Proposal 3 clarifies the interaction between FAS 10's cost accounting and the subsequent accounting for the completed intangible asset under standards like FAS 25. This is also primarily an accounting and financial reporting matter aimed at ensuring consistency across AAOIFI standards. It correctly identifies that the accumulated Istisna'a costs can form the basis for the customer's initial cost of the intangible asset. This interaction does not raise direct Shariah concerns regarding the contract's validity but is crucial for accurate financial representation of the transaction's outcome. However, care must be taken to ensure that the costs included align with what is permissible under Shariah for an Istisna'a contract (i.e., costs for developing a specified item).
Enhancement Proposal 4 addresses contract variations and scope changes, which are common in software development. Shariah allows parties to a binding contract (like Istisna'a) to mutually agree on modifications. The proposal's requirement for formal agreement on material changes and prospective adjustment of costs/revenue aligns with the Shariah principle of mutual consent (Taradhi) in contract amendments. Providing guidance on how to handle variations is essential for practical application and does not conflict with Shariah. Treating a fundamental change as a potentially separate contract is also permissible by mutual agreement.
Overall, the proposed enhancements appear to be a sensible and necessary adaptation of the Istisna'a standard to accommodate intangible assets. They aim to apply the spirit of Shariah principles (like defining the subject matter to avoid Gharar) to a new asset class, while providing practical accounting guidance. However, ensuring that the practical application truly upholds the Shariah requirements, particularly regarding the sufficiency of the subject matter definition and the nature of included costs, requires careful attention.
Concerns:
-  **Sufficiency of Intangible Definition and Gharar:** While Proposal 1 adapts the definition of the Mushna' by listing relevant characteristics for intangibles, the practical challenge lies in ensuring that defining "core capabilities, system architecture principles, key features, and acceptance criteria" is truly sufficient to remove excessive uncertainty (Gharar) at the outset for complex or novel software projects. Vague or overly high-level initial specifications, even if covering "core" elements, could lead to significant disputes or fundamental scope changes that undermine the initial contract basis and potentially invalidate it from a Shariah perspective due to excessive Gharar.
-  **Exclusion of Research/Exploratory Costs:** The Shariah requirement for Istisna'a is that the Mushna' can be manufactured or constructed based on known specifications. Software development often includes phases that are exploratory or akin to research, where the feasibility or specific outcome is uncertain or not yet clearly specified. Costs incurred during such pure research or highly uncertain exploratory phases do not strictly relate to the manufacturing or construction of a *specified* Mushna' as required by Shariah for Istisna'a. While Proposal 2 lists cost categories, it doesn't explicitly guide on excluding costs related to pure research or highly uncertain exploratory work that doesn't directly contribute to the defined Mushna', potentially blurring the line between permissible Istisna'a costs (for a specified item) and non-attributable expenditures from a Shariah perspective.
-  **Alignment of Istisna'a Costs with Development Criteria:** Proposal 3 correctly references FAS 25, which includes criteria for capitalizing internally generated intangible assets (distinguishing research from development, demonstrating technical feasibility, etc.). From a Shariah perspective, the costs included in the Istisna'a calculation should be those genuinely incurred for the *development* or *manufacturing* of the specified Mushna'. This aligns with the concept of development costs, not research costs. The proposals need to explicitly ensure that costs accumulated under FAS 10 for the intangible Mushna' are only those that would meet the criteria for development costs analogous to FAS 25 principles, thereby excluding costs that are effectively research or pre-development exploration from the Istisna'a cost base.
-  **Subjectivity in Application:** Terms used across the proposals such as "sufficient detail" (for Mushna' definition), "material changes," "significantly alters the nature," and "systematic and rational basis" (for cost allocation) inherently involve a degree of subjective judgment. Without further clarification or examples, this subjectivity could lead to inconsistent application by different parties and potentially cause disputes that could be linked back to insufficient clarity in the contract terms or accounting, which Shariah aims to minimize.
Recommendations:
-  **Enhance Guidance on Intangible Mushna' Definition:** Strengthen Proposal 1 by adding more detailed guidance or illustrative examples (possibly in implementation notes or appendices) on what constitutes a "sufficiently described" intangible asset (like software) for Istisna'a purposes. This guidance should provide practical benchmarks or criteria for the level of detail required for different project complexities to minimize Gharar and ensure the Mushna' is genuinely specified at contract inception, clear enough to avoid fundamental disputes about its core nature or functionality.
-  **Explicitly Exclude Research/Exploratory Costs:** Amend Proposal 2 (Section Z.1) to explicitly state that costs incurred during phases of intangible development that are purely exploratory or akin to research, where the existence or specific form of the outcome (the Mushna') is highly uncertain or not yet specified, shall be excluded as direct or attributable costs of the Istisna'a contract. These costs do not align with the Shariah nature of Istisna'a as a contract for manufacturing a *specified* item.
-  **Strengthen Linkage to Development Criteria for Costs:** In Proposal 3 (Section Z.2), clarify that the costs accumulated under the Istisna'a contract framework (determined per Z.1) for the intangible Mushna' should, from the perspective of creating the specified asset, correspond to expenditures that would meet the criteria for capitalization of an internally generated intangible asset (excluding research) under AAOIFI FAS 25 principles. This ensures that the costs recognized under Istisna'a relate to the *development* of the specified asset, aligning with the Shariah nature of the contract.
-  **Ensure Shariah Board Review and Endorsement:** It is crucial that these proposed amendments, particularly those related to defining the subject matter (Proposal 1), the types of costs included/excluded (Proposal 2, Recommendation 2 & 3), and the handling of significant variations (Proposal 4, especially segmentation criteria), are formally reviewed and approved by the AAOIFI Shariah Board. This is essential to confirm their full compliance with the underlying Shariah principles of Istisna'a when applied to intangible assets and to provide the necessary Shariah endorsement for these adaptations within the standard.

Round 3 - finance:
Analysis: The proposal presents a well-structured and necessary approach to adapting AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 10, which traditionally governs Istisna'a contracts for tangible assets, to the unique characteristics of intangible assets, particularly software development. From a finance perspective, the proposals effectively identify and address the key challenges posed by applying a standard likely drafted with manufacturing and construction in mind to dynamic, non-physical outputs.
1.  **Enhancement Proposal 1: Clarifying "Well-Defined Subject Matter" for Intangible Assets:** This proposal is fundamental for the practical application of Istisna'a to intangibles. Sharia requires a clearly defined subject matter (Mushna') to avoid Gharar (uncertainty), which is straightforward for tangible assets. For software, shifting the definition focus from physical attributes (dimensions, materials) to functional requirements, technical specifications, performance criteria, and intended use is the correct and necessary adaptation. This aligns with how software development contracts are typically scoped. Acknowledging the iterative nature while requiring definition of core capabilities upfront provides pragmatic flexibility needed for complex software projects while aiming to maintain the core principle of knowing what is being developed. This clarity is vital for both parties: the customer (buyer) to understand the asset being acquired and the contractor (developer) to estimate costs and plan execution reliably.
2.  **Enhancement Proposal 2: Guidance on "Determination of Cost" for Intangible Development:** Accurate cost accumulation is crucial for financial reporting under Istisna'a, especially if using the percentage-of-completion method for revenue and cost recognition or for determining the final asset cost. The proposed text provides valuable practical guidance by listing cost categories highly relevant to software development (labor, development licenses, infrastructure). Software development costs are predominantly related to human effort and supporting technology/infrastructure, not raw materials. Explicitly including these as direct or attributable costs within the Istisna'a framework makes the standard operational for intangible projects and enhances the reliability of cost measurement. The exclusion of general administrative overhead is consistent with standard cost accounting principles for specific projects.
3.  **Enhancement Proposal 3: Interaction with Intangible Asset Accounting Principles:** This proposal is critical for ensuring consistency and completeness within the broader AAOIFI financial reporting framework. Clarifying that the accumulated costs under the Istisna'a contract represent the basis for the *customer's* initial cost of the resulting intangible asset is essential for linking contract accounting (FAS 10) to asset accounting (FAS 25). Mandating compliance with relevant AAOIFI standards for intangible assets (like FAS 25) for subsequent accounting (e.g., amortization, impairment, derecognition) is correct and ensures that the completed asset is accounted for based on established principles for intangibles post-acquisition/completion. Clarifying the contractor's perspective on costs and revenue is also helpful for a complete picture.
4.  **Enhancement Proposal 4: Handling Scope Changes and Variations:** Contract variations are inherent in complex, long-term projects, particularly in software development due to evolving requirements, technical discoveries, or market changes. Providing specific guidance on how to handle these variations within the Istisna'a framework is highly practical. Requiring formal agreement for material changes ensures proper governance and documentation, which is important for both project management and auditability. Prospectively adjusting cost and revenue estimates for agreed variations aligns with standard contract accounting practices. The concept of potentially treating a significant variation as a separate contract provides a necessary mechanism for dealing with fundamental shifts in project scope, which is highly relevant for dynamic intangible development projects.
Overall, the proposals demonstrate a strong understanding of the financial reporting implications of Istisna'a and the unique nature of intangible assets. They offer sensible adaptations that aim to maintain the core structure of the Istisna'a contract while providing necessary flexibility and clarity for financial reporting in the context of technology assets. They represent a significant step towards making FAS 10 a more relevant and applicable standard in the digital economy, facilitating Islamic finance involvement in technology development.
Concerns:
-  **Subjectivity in Key Definitions and Assessments:** While the proposed text introduces relevant concepts for intangible assets, terms such as "sufficient detail" (for Mushna' definition in Proposal 1), "material changes," "significantly alters the nature," and "separate, distinct development effort" for variations (Proposal 4), and "systematic and rational basis" for cost allocation (Proposal 2) still involve a considerable degree of subjective judgment. Without further detailed guidance or illustrative examples, this subjectivity could lead to inconsistent application across different financial institutions and projects, potentially impacting the comparability and auditability of financial statements.
-  **Alignment with FAS 25 Capitalization Criteria (Customer):** Proposal 3 states that accumulated FAS 10 costs "represent the cost of the acquired intangible asset" for the customer. This phrasing might be interpreted as implying that all costs incurred by the contractor under the Istisna'a contract are automatically capitalizable by the customer. However, AAOIFI FAS 25 (likely aligned with IAS 38) includes specific criteria that must be met for development costs to qualify for capitalization as an intangible asset (e.g., technical feasibility, intention/ability to complete, probable future economic benefits, ability to measure cost reliably). The Istisna'a structure is primarily a method of *financing* or *acquiring* the asset's development. The standard needs to explicitly clarify that the costs accumulated under FAS 10 must *also* meet the capitalization criteria of FAS 25 from the customer's perspective throughout the development period to be recognized as an intangible asset on the balance sheet. Costs incurred by the contractor and paid for by the customer via the Istisna'a structure but not meeting FAS 25 criteria from the customer's viewpoint should arguably be expensed by the customer in the period incurred.
-  **Distinguishing Between Contract Costs and General/Research Costs (Contractor):** Proposal 2 provides cost categories, and Proposal 3 mentions the contractor's accounting for non-contract-specific know-how. However, in complex technology development, distinguishing between costs directly attributable to the *specific* defined Mushna' (accounted for under the Istisna'a contract) and costs related to underlying reusable technology platforms, general R&D, or exploratory work that might inform the project but aren't solely for the specific contract, can be challenging for the contractor. Clearer guidance is needed to ensure only costs directly related to building the *specified* Mushna' are included in the Istisna'a contract costs, aligning with the nature of the Istisna'a contract itself.
-  **Reliability of Progress Measurement for Intangibles:** If FAS 10 allows for the use of percentage-of-completion (PoC) as a revenue and cost recognition method for Istisna'a contracts (which is common for long-term construction/manufacturing contracts), applying this method to intangible development presents unique challenges. Measuring the stage of completion for software development can be highly subjective and difficult to do reliably and objectively upfront compared to physical completion measures used for tangible assets. The standard might need more specific guidance on acceptable and reliable methods for measuring progress for intangible Istisna'a contracts to ensure accurate and verifiable revenue/cost recognition over time under PoC.
Recommendations:
-  **Enhance Guidance on Subjectivity:** Supplement the proposed text within the standard or through accompanying implementation guidance with detailed explanations and illustrative examples. These examples should demonstrate what level of detail in functional, technical, and performance specifications is considered "sufficiently described" for different types of software or intangible assets. Provide examples of how to assess "material changes" and what might constitute a "separate, distinct development effort" in the context of intangible variations. Also, offer guidance on acceptable methods for establishing a "systematic and rational basis" for allocating indirect costs.
-  **Strengthen Linkage to FAS 25 Capitalization Criteria:** Modify the proposed text in Z.2 or add a new sub-point to explicitly state that while costs accumulated under FAS 10 form the basis for the customer's potential asset cost, the customer must assess these costs against the capitalization criteria outlined in AAOIFI FAS 25 throughout the development period. Only costs that meet the FAS 25 criteria should be capitalized by the customer as an intangible asset; costs that do not meet these criteria (e.g., those related to research-like phases within the contract) should be expensed by the customer in the period incurred, even if contractually incurred as part of the Istisna'a.
-  **Clarify Cost Allocation Principles for Contractors, Especially Research vs. Development:** Add more detailed guidance, potentially within Z.1 or Z.2, specifically for the contractor. This guidance should help contractors distinguish between costs directly attributable to the specific Istisna'a Mushna' (accounted for under the contract) and costs related to general technological know-how, reusable components, or research phases that are not solely for the specific contract. Emphasize that only costs incurred for the *development* of the *specified* Mushna' should be included in the Istisna'a contract costs.
-  **Provide Guidance on Progress Measurement for Intangibles:** If percentage-of-completion is a permitted accounting method under FAS 10 for intangible Istisna'a, include specific guidance within the accounting section on practical and reliable methods for measuring the stage of completion for such contracts. This could include guidance on using output measures (e.g., achievement of defined milestones subject to verification, completion of specific modules/features subject to acceptance testing) or input measures (e.g., labor hours incurred relative to total estimated labor hours, with caveats regarding efficiency and potential rework), along with requirements for reliable estimation and verification processes.
-  **Address Accounting for Risk, Acceptance, and Project Outcomes:** Add a section or clarification within the accounting guidance on how to treat costs accumulated and revenue recognized if the developed intangible asset fails to meet acceptance criteria, the project encounters significant technical hurdles leading to rework or scope reduction, or the project is ultimately unsuccessful or abandoned. This is crucial for practical risk management and accurate financial reporting in the context of intangible development.

Round 3 - standards:
Analysis: The proposal offers a well-structured and necessary set of enhancements to AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 10 to address its applicability to intangible assets, particularly software development. The current standard, likely framed with tangible assets in mind, presents significant challenges when applied to the dynamic and non-physical nature of intangibles. The proposed modifications tackle the core issues identified: defining the subject matter (Mushna'), determining relevant costs, clarifying the relationship with intangible asset accounting standards, and managing contract variations.
Proposal 1's adaptation of the "well-defined subject matter" requirement from physical attributes to functional/technical specifications is a fundamental and appropriate step for intangibles, acknowledging the iterative nature of development while requiring clarity on the core scope. This aligns the standard with how intangible development contracts are practically structured.
Proposal 2 provides valuable guidance on cost determination by listing cost categories specific to software development. This makes the standard's cost accumulation principles practical for intangible assets, where labor and infrastructure costs are predominant, rather than raw materials. Explicitly excluding general overhead is also consistent with cost accounting principles.
Proposal 3 correctly identifies the crucial link between the Istisna'a contract costs (accounted for under FAS 10) and the subsequent accounting for the completed intangible asset on the customer's balance sheet. Mandating compliance with relevant intangible asset standards like FAS 25 is essential for consistency within the AAOIFI framework and ensures that the resulting asset is accounted for based on established principles for intangibles (amortization, impairment, etc.).
Proposal 4 addresses the common occurrence of scope changes in intangible development projects. Requiring formal agreement and prospective adjustment of estimates aligns with standard contract accounting practices for variations and provides a necessary framework for managing project evolution under the Istisna'a structure. The concept of treating significant variations as separate contracts is also a relevant consideration for complex projects.
Overall, the proposals demonstrate a good understanding of both the Istisna'a contract mechanics and the unique characteristics of intangible asset development. They aim to make FAS 10 a practical and robust standard for financing and accounting for technology assets under this contract structure, which is increasingly important. However, ensuring seamless integration with existing standards, particularly FAS 25, and providing sufficient clarity to limit subjective interpretation will be key challenges in finalizing these enhancements.
Concerns:
-  **Interaction with FAS 25 Capitalization Criteria:** The proposed text in Z.2 states that accumulated FAS 10 costs "represent the cost of the acquired intangible asset" for the customer. This wording might be interpreted as implying that all costs accumulated under the Istisna'a contract are automatically capitalizable by the customer. AAOIFI FAS 25 (Intangible Assets) includes specific criteria that must be met for development costs to be capitalized (e.g., technical feasibility, intention/ability to complete, probable future economic benefits, reliable measurement). The Istisna'a contract structure facilitates the acquisition, but the nature of the expenditures must still meet the FAS 25 criteria to be recognized as an intangible asset. The current wording does not explicitly require the customer to assess the accumulated costs against FAS 25 capitalization criteria throughout the development period, potentially leading to the capitalization of costs that would otherwise be expensed (e.g., research phase costs) under FAS 25 principles.
-  **Subjectivity in Definitions and Assessments:** While the proposed additions provide helpful guidance, terms like "sufficient detail" for defining the Mushna' (X.1), "material changes," "significantly alters the nature," or "separate, distinct development effort" (Y.1), and "systematic and rational basis" for cost allocation (Z.1) still involve a degree of subjective judgment. Without further clarification or examples, this could lead to inconsistent application of the standard across different IFIs or projects.
-  **Clarity on Research vs. Development Costs (Contractor & Customer):** Although Z.2 mentions the contractor's accounting for "internally developed components or know-how not specific to the contract," the distinction between costs directly attributable to the specific Istisna'a Mushna' and costs related to underlying technology platforms, reusable components, or general R&D that might inform the project is complex. Clearer guidance on this distinction is needed, particularly from the customer's perspective regarding which costs accumulated via the Istisna'a contract qualify for capitalization under FAS 25 and which should be expensed (e.g., costs incurred during stages akin to research).
-  **Integration into Standard Structure:** The proposal uses hypothetical section numbers. The actual integration of the proposed text into the existing structure of AAOIFI FAS 10 requires careful consideration to ensure logical flow, avoid conflicts with existing paragraphs, and maintain the overall coherence of the standard.
Recommendations:
-  **Refine Interaction with FAS 25:** Modify the proposed text in Z.2 or add a separate paragraph to explicitly state that while costs accumulated under the Istisna'a contract (determined per Z.1) form the basis of the potential asset cost for the customer, these costs must still meet the capitalization criteria specified in AAOIFI FAS 25 (Intangible Assets) to be recognized as an intangible asset on the customer's balance sheet. Clarify that costs accumulated under the contract that do not meet FAS 25 capitalization criteria (e.g., those akin to research phases) should be expensed by the customer.
-  **Develop Implementation Guidance:** Recommend the development of detailed implementation guidance, perhaps as an appendix to the standard or a separate document. This guidance should include illustrative examples to help clarify the application of subjective terms, particularly regarding: a) the required level of detail for defining intangible Mushna' (X.1) for different types of software/intangibles; b) assessing "material changes" and "significantly alters the nature" for variations (Y.1); and c) criteria for determining when a variation constitutes a "separate, distinct development effort" (Y.1).
-  **Clarify Research/Development Cost Distinction:** Add text, potentially in Z.1 or Z.2, to provide clearer guidance on distinguishing costs incurred within the Istisna'a contract that are akin to research phases from those related to development phases. Emphasize that costs related to research-like activities within the contract, from the customer's perspective, do not qualify for capitalization as part of the intangible asset cost under FAS 25 principles, even if contractually incurred. This should also address the contractor's perspective on costs that benefit multiple projects or contribute to general know-how.
-  **Review and Integrate Carefully:** Ensure that the final proposed text is meticulously reviewed for consistency with the rest of AAOIFI FAS 10 and integrated seamlessly into its existing structure, using clear and precise language typical of financial accounting standards. The hypothetical section numbering must be replaced with actual paragraph references.

Round 3 - practical:
Analysis: The proposed enhancements to AAOIFI FAS 10 offer a practical and necessary adaptation of a standard primarily designed for tangible assets to the unique characteristics of intangible assets, specifically software development. From a practical implementation perspective, the proposals correctly identify and address the key challenges faced when attempting to apply the existing standard to technology projects structured as Istisna'a.
Proposal 1 provides a pragmatic approach to defining the "well-defined subject matter" (Mushna') for intangibles by shifting the focus from physical attributes to functional and technical specifications. This aligns well with standard software development methodologies where requirements, architecture, and performance criteria define the product. Acknowledging the iterative nature while requiring core definition upfront strikes a reasonable balance between contractual certainty and project reality.
Proposal 2 offers crucial practical guidance on cost determination by listing typical cost categories in software development (labor, infrastructure, licenses). This is highly relevant as these are the primary cost drivers for intangible assets, unlike the raw materials focus often implied by tangible asset standards. This clarity is essential for reliably applying cost-based accounting methods under FAS 10.
Proposal 3 is vital for practical financial reporting by explicitly linking the costs accumulated under the Istisna'a contract to the customer's subsequent accounting for the completed intangible asset under AAOIFI FAS 25. This integration ensures consistency and provides a clear path for recognizing the asset on the balance sheet post-completion.
Proposal 4 directly addresses the common reality of scope changes in software development by providing a framework for handling variations through formal amendments and prospective adjustments. This aligns with standard project management practices for complex, long-term contracts and makes the standard more workable in a dynamic development environment.
Overall, the proposals lay a solid foundation for making Istisna'a a viable and clearly accounted-for contract type for technology development within Islamic finance. They reflect an understanding of both the contractual requirements and the practicalities of intangible asset creation. However, several areas require further practical clarity to ensure consistent and reliable implementation.
Concerns:
-  **Subjectivity in Key Definitions:** While the proposals provide examples, terms like "sufficient detail" for defining the Mushna', "material changes," "significantly alters the nature" for variations, and "systematic and rational basis" for cost allocation remain subjective. This lack of precise, objective criteria can lead to inconsistent interpretation and application across different projects and financial institutions.
-  **Practical Application of FAS 25 Capitalization Criteria:** Proposal 3 states that FAS 10 costs "represent the cost" for the customer, but it lacks practical guidance on *how* this aligns with the detailed capitalization criteria in AAOIFI FAS 25 (which are likely based on IAS 38 principles). It's unclear whether the Istisna'a structure means all contract costs are automatically capitalizable by the customer, or if the customer must still rigorously assess these costs against FAS 25 criteria throughout the development period (e.g., distinguishing research-like phases from development phases that meet capitalization criteria). This ambiguity poses a significant practical challenge for the customer's accounting and could lead to inappropriate capitalization.
-  **Reliability of Progress Measurement for Intangibles:** If FAS 10 permits the use of percentage-of-completion for revenue and cost recognition, reliably measuring the stage of completion for intangible development is practically challenging. Unlike physical completion, software development progress is often less objectively verifiable upfront. The standard lacks specific guidance on practical and reliable methods for measuring progress in software development Istisna'a contracts.
-  **Accounting for Project Risk and Failure:** Software development carries inherent technical and functional risks, and projects can encounter significant rework, fail to meet acceptance criteria, or be abandoned. The proposal mentions acceptance criteria, but there is limited practical guidance on how accumulated costs and recognized revenue should be treated in scenarios of project failure, non-acceptance, or significant technical hurdles leading to rework.
Recommendations:
-  **Develop Detailed Implementation Guidance and Examples:** To reduce subjectivity, supplement the standard with comprehensive implementation guidance and illustrative examples. These should demonstrate what constitutes "sufficient detail" for defining various types of intangible Mushna' (potentially referencing industry documentation standards like detailed functional specifications or technical architecture documents), provide criteria for assessing the materiality of variations, and illustrate what constitutes a "separate, distinct development effort."
-  **Provide Explicit Guidance on FAS 25 Capitalization Linkage:** Enhance Proposal 3 (or add a new section) to provide clear, step-by-step practical guidance on how the cost accumulation under FAS 10 interacts with the application of AAOIFI FAS 25 capitalization criteria from the customer's perspective. Explicitly clarify that costs incurred by the contractor *for the contract* are capitalizable by the customer *only after* the FAS 25 criteria (e.g., technical feasibility, probable future economic benefits) for the specific project phase or overall asset are met, and that costs akin to research phases within the contract should be expensed by the customer.
-  **Include Guidance on Progress Measurement for Intangibles:** If percentage-of-completion is a permitted method under FAS 10 for intangible Istisna'a, add specific guidance within the accounting section on practical and reliable methods for measuring the stage of completion for such contracts. This could include guidance on using verifiable milestones, output-based measures (e.g., completed and accepted features/modules), or input measures (like labor hours), along with necessary caveats regarding reliability and verification.
-  **Address Accounting for Risk, Acceptance, and Failure:** Add a section or clarification within the accounting guidance providing practical guidance on how to treat costs accumulated and revenue recognized if the developed intangible asset fails to meet acceptance criteria, requires significant rework due to technical issues, or if the project is unsuccessful or abandoned. This is crucial for practical risk management and accurate financial reporting.

For tangible assets, this typically involves detailed physical specifications, dimensions, materials, quality standards, location (for construction), etc.\n*   **Issue in Trigger Scenario (AI Software):** Defining a large-scale AI software platform "precisely" at the outset of a multi-year development project is inherently difficult, if not impossible, in the same way one defines a building or a machine. Software development, especially for complex AI, is often iterative. Requirements evolve based on user feedback, technological advancements, unforeseen technical challenges, and the discovery of new possibilities during development.\n    *   How does "well-defined" apply to functional requirements, performance metrics, algorithms, datasets, and user experience, which are the key characteristics of software?\n    *   What level of detail is required?

Does the standard provide guidance on how variations affect the initial definition and the accounting treatment?\n*   **Why this is an issue:** Applying a strict "well-defined" requirement meant for physical objects to dynamic software development can render Istisna\'a impractical for such projects or force artificial constraints on the development process. It creates uncertainty for financial institutions and developers on whether the contract truly qualifies as a valid Istisna\'a under the standard and how to account for inevitable changes. The standard needs to clarify how the "well-defined" principle applies to intangible assets, perhaps allowing for definition based on detailed functional specifications, performance criteria, and a structured change management process rather than purely physical attributes.\n\n**2. Potential Gap/Ambiguity: "Determination of Cost" and Accounting for Development Costs**\n\n*   **Standard\'s Likely Requirement:** FAS 10 would outline how costs related to the Istisna\'a contract are accumulated and accounted for (e.g., using the percentage-of-completion or completed-contract method). This typically involves identifying direct costs (materials, labor) and attributable overhead related to the manufacturing or construction process.\n*   **Issue in Trigger Scenario (AI Software):**\n    *   **Cost Structure:** The cost structure of software development is vastly different from physical manufacturing. Labor (developers, data scientists, project managers) constitutes a much larger proportion of the cost compared to materials. Infrastructure (cloud computing, development tools) and potentially third-party data or model licenses are significant.\n    *   **Uncertainty:** Costs in complex software development are often less predictable than in established manufacturing processes. Technical hurdles, the need for extensive R&D-like activities (especially in AI), and evolving scope can significantly impact final costs.\n    *   **Intangible Asset Accounting:** Accounting for the *asset* itself (the developed software) typically follows principles for intangible assets (e.g., IAS 38). This involves distinguishing between research and development phases and applying capitalization criteria based on technical feasibility, intention to complete, ability to use/sell, probable future economic benefits, and ability to measure cost reliably. Does FAS 10\'s cost accounting framework for a "Mushna\'" align with or conflict with these principles for capitalizing intangible software development costs?\n    *   **Revenue Recognition:** The method of cost accumulation directly impacts revenue recognition under percentage-of-completion. If costs are uncertain or not clearly defined in the standard for software, applying this method becomes challenging and subjective.\n*   **Why this is an issue:** The standard\'s guidance on cost determination, likely framed for tangible inputs and processes, may not adequately address the unique cost structure and uncertainties of software development. It creates ambiguity on how to accumulate and classify software development costs within the Istisna\'a framework and how these costs relate to the eventual recognition of the AI platform as an intangible asset on the balance sheet.

Handling scope changes and variations in intangible development contracts.\n\n**Validation Checks:**\n\n1.  **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n    *   **Core Principles:** The proposals do not introduce Riba, Maysir, or unethical elements. They primarily focus on clarifying the application of Istisna\'a to a new asset class within the existing Shariah framework.\n    *   **Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty):** The core Shariah principle relevant here is the requirement to remove *Jahalah* (ignorance/uncertainty) regarding the subject matter (Mushna\') and the price to avoid Gharar.\n        *   *Proposal 1 (Well-Defined Subject Matter):* This proposal directly addresses the potential for Gharar regarding the subject matter when dealing with dynamic intangibles. By clarifying that "well-defined" for software means defining *functional requirements, technical specifications, performance criteria, and intended use* (rather than physical attributes), it provides a mechanism to remove fundamental uncertainty about *what* is being developed. Acknowledging the evolution of *detailed design* while requiring *core capabilities* to be defined upfront seems a reasonable adaptation consistent with the *Maslaha* (public good/common need) or *Qiyas* basis for Istisna\'a validity (as mentioned in FAS 10 paras 3/1, 3/2, 3/3), which permits the contract despite the subject matter not being in existence at the time of contracting, provided its description removes uncertainty. This adaptation ensures the Mushna\' is sufficiently known to form a valid contract, mitigating Gharar.\n        *   *Proposal 2 (Determination of Cost):* This proposal deals with accounting for costs incurred by the Sani\', not the determination of the fixed contract price (which is a separate Shariah requirement for Istisna\'a). Clarifying which costs are includable in the *accounting* for the contract helps in reliably measuring progress (for percentage-of-completion) and determining profit/loss, which enhances transparency but does not impact the core Shariah compliance of the contract terms themselves.\n        *   *Proposal 4 (Scope Changes):* Requiring formal contract amendments for material changes and prospective adjustments is consistent with maintaining clarity and avoiding Gharar regarding the scope and price throughout the project lifecycle. Treating significant changes as new contracts further reinforces the need for defined terms for each distinct deliverable.\n    *   **FAS 10 Specific Principles:**\n        *   *Specification of Subject Matter:* Proposal 1 directly addresses this by adapting the principle for intangibles, aligning with the need to remove *Jahalah* per FAS 10 para 4/1/1.\n        *   *Fixed Price:* The proposals do not alter the requirement for a fixed price, which remains a core condition for Istisna\'a.\n        *   *Liability and Risk:* The proposals do not alter the Sani\'s liability until delivery.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on Shariah Compliance:** The proposed enhancements appear to be Shariah-compliant as they adapt the application of existing Istisna\'a principles to intangible assets in a way that maintains the core requirements of removing Gharar from the subject matter and price, leveraging the underlying rationale for Istisna\'a\'s permissibility.\n\n2.  **Consistency Check (Internal & External):**\n    *   **Internal Consistency (with FAS 10):**\n        *   *Proposal 1:* It extends the principle in FAS 10 para 4/1/1 to a new asset class without contradicting the general rule. It acknowledges that the *description* changes from physical to functional/technical, which is a necessary adaptation.\n        *   *Proposal 2:* It provides specific examples for the types of costs mentioned generally in FAS 10 para 2/1 (Direct costs, Indirect costs relating to the contract). It correctly excludes general overhead and R&D, consistent with para 2/1(a). This adds necessary detail for intangible development costs.\n        *   *Proposal 4:* It builds upon the concept of \'Change Orders\' and \'Additional Claims\' already present in FAS 10 (e.g., paras 2/5, definitions in Appendix G). It provides specific guidance for handling variations in the context of intangible development, which is consistent with the standard\'s approach to contract modifications. The prospective adjustment aligns with standard accounting for changes in estimates on long-term contracts, which is implied by the use of percentage-of-completion (FAS 10 para 11, Basis for Conclusions).\n    *   **External Consistency (with other related standards):**\n        *   *Proposal 3:* This proposal is crucial for external consistency. It explicitly links FAS 10\'s cost accumulation (for the Sani\' and the customer\'s resulting asset cost) with the subsequent accounting for the intangible asset under relevant AAOIFI standards, specifically referencing FAS 25 (Intangible Assets). This is consistent with the structure of accounting standards where contract accounting (like FAS 10) leads to the recognition of an asset, which is then accounted for under specific asset standards (like FAS 25 or a standard on tangible assets). This promotes a coherent framework across the AAOIFI standards. FAS 4 mentions valuation of intangible assets as capital contribution, showing AAOIFI standards already consider intangibles, reinforcing the need for consistent treatment.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on Consistency:** The proposed enhancements are consistent with the principles and existing clauses of FAS 10 and improve consistency with other related AAOIFI standards, particularly by clarifying the interaction with intangible asset accounting.\n\n3.  **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n    *   **Proposal 1:** Defining software by functional and technical specifications is standard practice in the software industry. Acknowledging the iterative nature and allowing for phased definition or evolution of *detailed design* (while fixing core scope) reflects real-world software development methodologies (like Agile or phased Waterfall). This makes Istisna\'a a practical option for financing such projects.\n    *   **Proposal 2:** Listing typical cost categories for software development provides practical guidance for financial institutions and contractors on how to track costs for accounting purposes, making the application of accounting methods like percentage-of-completion more straightforward.\n    *   **Proposal 3:** Clearly directing users to the relevant intangible asset standard (FAS 25) for subsequent accounting (amortization, impairment, etc.) is practical and avoids duplicating complex rules within FAS 10.\n    *   **Proposal 4:** Requiring formal amendments for material changes and outlining the accounting treatment (prospective adjustment, potential separate contract) provides a practical framework for managing and accounting for variations, which are common in software development.\n\n    *   **Conclusion on Practical Implementation:** The proposed enhancements provide practical, implementable guidance tailored to the specifics of intangible asset development, addressing key challenges faced when applying the current standard.\n\n4.  **Final Decision:**\n\nBased on the evaluation:\n\n*   The proposals are Shariah-compliant, adapting Istisna\'a principles appropriately for intangible assets while maintaining the core requirements to avoid Gharar.\n*   They enhance internal consistency within FAS 10 and improve external consistency by linking to other relevant standards (FAS 25).\n*   They provide practical and implementable guidance for applying Istisna\'a to modern transactions involving intangible assets like software.\n*   The proposals directly address the uncertainties identified in the trigger scenario regarding subject matter definition and cost determination.\n\nTherefore, the proposed enhancements are well-justified and necessary to make FAS 10 applicable to the financing and accounting of intangible asset development using Istisna\'a.\n\n**Decision:** APPROVED\n\n**Detailed Reasoning:** The proposed enhancements successfully bridge the gap between a standard traditionally applied to tangible assets and the unique characteristics of intangible assets like software. By providing specific guidance on defining the subject matter based on functional/technical specifications, detailing relevant cost categories, clarifying the interaction with intangible asset accounting standards, and outlining the treatment of variations, the proposal makes Istisna\'a a practical and clearly accountable Islamic finance structure for technology development projects. This is achieved without compromising the fundamental Shariah principles underlying Istisna\'a, leveraging the standard\'s existing basis for flexibility (Istihsan, Maslaha, Qiyas) to adapt the "well-defined" requirement and building upon existing accounting principles for cost accumulation and contract variations. The explicit link to FAS 25 ensures a coherent and comprehensive accounting treatment for the resulting intangible asset.'}
