# Standards Enhancement Results - FAS 10

## Trigger Scenario

A financial institution wants to structure an Istisna'a contract for the development 
                              of a large-scale AI software platform. The current wording of FAS 10 on 'well-defined 
                              subject matter' and 'determination of cost' is causing uncertainty for intangible assets 
                              like software development.

## Initial Analysis

## Enhancement Proposal

Okay, acting as the Standards Enhancement Proposer Agent for AAOIFI, I will propose specific enhancements to FAS 10 based on the reviewer's analysis concerning the application of Istisna'a to complex intangible assets like AI software development.

The analysis identified issues related to the 'well-defined subject matter' and 'determination of cost/fixed price' requirements when applied to the iterative and uncertain nature of complex software development.

Here are the proposed enhancements:

---

**Enhancement 1: Clarification on Defining Intangible Subject Matter**

**Issue:** The existing standard's requirement for a precisely described/well-defined subject matter is challenging for intangible assets like complex software, where the final specifications may evolve during development.

**Proposed Change:** Add guidance within the standard, potentially in a dedicated section or as an interpretation note under the relevant clause defining the subject matter requirements.

**Original Principle (Conceptual based on analysis):**
*   *The subject matter of the Istisna'a contract must be precisely described and well-defined at the time the contract is concluded.*

**Proposed Modified Text (Addition/Clarification):**

"**X.X Clarification on Defining Intangible Subject Matter**

When the subject matter of an Istisna'a contract is an intangible asset, such as software, digital platforms, or intellectual property, the requirement for it to be 'precisely described and well-defined' shall be interpreted in a manner appropriate to the nature of the asset.

For complex intangible assets, particularly those involving significant research, development, or novel technology (such as advanced software or AI platforms), a precise description may focus on defining:

a)  The **core purpose and intended functionalities** of the asset.
b)  Key **performance benchmarks and acceptance criteria** that the completed asset must meet.
c)  The **deliverables** to be provided (e.g., source code, documentation, trained models, deployment scripts).
d)  Significant **architectural constraints or technical specifications** agreed upon.

While a complete, exhaustive, and static list of every feature may be impractical or subject to iterative refinement during development, the contract must clearly define the overall scope, intended outcome, and the key characteristics and deliverables that constitute the completed subject matter. Phased definition linked to agreed-upon milestones may be acceptable, provided the overall framework and criteria for subsequent phases are established upfront and any variations are managed through Shariah-compliant mechanisms."

**Rationale:**

*   This proposed text directly addresses the ambiguity identified in applying "precisely described" to intangible assets.
*   It provides a framework for defining complex software/AI by focusing on purpose, performance, deliverables, and acceptance criteria, which are more suitable metrics for such assets than static feature lists.
*   It acknowledges the reality of iterative development and phased definition common in technology projects, offering a practical interpretation while still upholding the core requirement of a defined subject matter.
*   It ensures that despite the flexibility, the overall scope and success criteria are established contractually, providing clarity for both parties and the financing institution.

---

**Enhancement 2: Addressing Pricing and Cost for Complex Projects with Uncertainty**

**Issue:** The requirement for a fixed price determined upfront is challenging for complex software development due to inherent cost uncertainty and potential scope changes.

**Proposed Change:** Add guidance on how the fixed-price principle applies to projects with variable costs and potential scope evolution, potentially within the section on pricing or in a dedicated section for complex/intangible assets.

**Original Principle (Conceptual based on analysis):**
*   *The price of the Istisna'a contract must be fixed and determined at the time the contract is concluded.*

**Proposed Modified Text (Addition/Clarification):**

"**Y.Y Application of Fixed Price Principle to Complex Projects**

The requirement for the price of the Istisna'a contract to be fixed and determined at the time of contracting applies universally. However, when the subject matter is a complex asset, particularly an intangible one like advanced software, where development costs may have inherent uncertainty, the determination of the fixed price shall reflect this complexity.

The fixed price established upfront should represent the agreed-upon cost for delivering the precisely described subject matter (as clarified in X.X). This fixed price may:

a)  Be based on the best available estimates of the effort and resources required, potentially incorporating a reasonable **contingency** for defined and anticipated risks inherent in the development process, explicitly disclosed and agreed upon by both parties.
b)  Be structured into **phased payments** linked to the achievement of specific, verifiable milestones or the delivery of defined components, but the total price for the *entire agreed-upon scope* must be fixed at the outset.

Any **variations or changes in the scope** of the subject matter requested after contract signing must be handled through a formal, Shariah-compliant **change management process**. This process shall involve a clear agreement on the impact of the variation on the original scope, the price, and the delivery timeline. Any resulting adjustment to the total consideration shall be treated as a separate agreement or an amendment to the original contract, with the price for the additional or modified scope being determined and agreed upon at the time of the change request, ensuring the principle of determined price for the agreed subject matter is maintained for both the original and modified components."

**Rationale:**

*   This proposal reaffirms the fundamental fixed-price principle but provides practical ways to apply it to projects with cost uncertainty.
*   It suggests mechanisms like incorporating contingencies (transparently) and using phased payments linked to milestones, which are common and necessary practices in managing complex projects.
*   Crucially, it addresses the inevitable issue of scope changes by requiring a formal, Shariah-compliant change management process. This clarifies that while the *original* price is fixed for the *original* scope, *agreed modifications* are handled separately, ensuring the price for *each defined element* (original or modified) is determined at the time of agreement.
*   This approach balances the Shariah requirement of a determined price with the commercial reality of complex development projects.

**Enhancement 3: Specific Considerations Section for Intangible Assets**

**Issue:** Intangible assets have unique characteristics that differ significantly from tangible goods, requiring specific considerations within the Istisna'a framework.

**Proposed Change:** Add a new, dedicated section or appendix to the standard outlining specific considerations when applying Istisna'a to intangible assets.

**Proposed Modified Text (New Section):**

"**Section Z: Specific Considerations for Istisna'a of Intangible Assets**

Applying the principles of Istisna'a to the creation of intangible assets (such as software, digital content, intellectual property, etc.) requires careful consideration of their unique nature. This section highlights key points:

**Z.1 Defining Completion and Delivery:** Unlike tangible assets, completion and delivery of intangible assets may involve different criteria. The contract should clearly define what constitutes 'completion' (e.g., meeting acceptance criteria, passing tests) and 'delivery' (e.g., providing access to source code repositories, deploying to a specific environment, transferring licenses).

**Z.2 Inspection and Acceptance:** Inspection and acceptance processes for intangible assets should be clearly defined in the contract, focusing on verifying functionality, performance, security, and compliance with agreed specifications and acceptance criteria (as defined in X.X).

**Z.3 Intellectual Property Rights:** The contract must explicitly address the ownership and licensing of intellectual property rights pertaining to the developed asset, ensuring Shariah compliance regarding the transfer or use of such rights.

**Z.4 Maintenance and Support:** Agreements for post-completion maintenance, support, or future updates are typically separate service contracts (Ijara or Ujrah-based) and should not be conflated with the Istisna'a contract for the creation of the initial asset.

**Z.5 Development Environment and Tools:** While the subject matter is intangible, the contract may need to specify requirements related to the development environment, tools, or platforms used, especially if they impact the final asset's compatibility or functionality.

**Z.6 Confidentiality and Data Security:** Given the nature of digital assets, specific clauses regarding confidentiality, data security, and privacy during the development process may be necessary."

**Rationale:**

*   This proposed new section provides a dedicated space to address the unique aspects of intangible assets under Istisna'a.
*   It guides practitioners on specific contractual points that need attention (delivery, IP, maintenance, etc.) which are different from those for tangible goods.
*   This helps ensure that contracts for intangible assets are comprehensive and align the Istisna'a framework with the practicalities of technology development and ownership.

These proposed enhancements aim to make AAOIFI FAS 10 more robust and applicable to modern financial transactions involving complex, intangible assets, while maintaining fidelity to the core Shariah principles of Istisna'a. They provide necessary clarification and guidance without fundamentally altering the nature of the contract.

## Expert Discussion

### Round 1

#### Shariah Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposal pragmatically adapts Istisna'a principles for complex intangible assets like software, addressing challenges in defining subject matter and fixing price. It balances Shariah requirements for certainty (`gharar`) with the realities of iterative development by focusing on outcome, performance, and using structured change management for price adjustments on modified scope.

**Concerns:**

-  The concept of 'contingency' within the fixed price needs precise definition to prevent it becoming a variable cost element.
-  Ensuring the change management process strictly results in a *new fixed price* for each agreed scope variation *at the time of the change*.

**Recommendations:**

-  Clarify that any 'contingency' must be a quantified amount included in the initial fixed price, not a mechanism for variable cost recovery.
-  Emphasize that the change management process *must* conclude with a determined and fixed price for the revised scope before work commences on the variation.

#### Finance Expert

**Analysis:**



#### Standards Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposal attempts to apply Istisna'a to complex intangibles by interpreting existing principles. Key issues arise around precisely defining the subject matter and fixing the price upfront for inherently uncertain development processes. Clarifications on defining scope via function/performance and managing price via structured changes are critical but require careful drafting to avoid Gharar.

**Concerns:**

-  Risk of Gharar (uncertainty) if the definition of "precisely described" for intangibles or the application of "fixed price" via contingency/phased definition is not strictly constrained by Shariah requirements.
-  Ensuring the proposed "Shariah-compliant change management process" explicitly requires a new, determined price for any modified scope *at the time* of the change request.

**Recommendations:**

-  Rigorously define terms like "contingency," "performance benchmarks," and "phased definition" within Shariah parameters to maintain certainty in subject matter and price.
-  Mandate that the change management process necessitates a clear, determined price agreement for the revised scope at the point of contract amendment.

### Round 2

#### Shariah Expert

**Analysis:**

The proposed enhancements provide practical interpretations for applying Istisna'a to intangible assets, addressing subject matter definition and fixed price requirements. They aim to align Shariah principles with the realities of complex software development through structured definitions and change management.

**Concerns:**

- Risk that "contingency" is interpreted as a variable cost recovery mechanism rather than a fixed component of the initial price.
- Ensuring the change management process guarantees a new *fixed price* for the revised scope *at the time* the change is agreed upon.

**Recommendations:**

- Explicitly state that contingency is a fixed amount factored *into* the initial price, not a variable addition.
- Mandate that the change management process requires full agreement on the *fixed price* of the revised scope *before* any related work begins.

#### Finance Expert

**Analysis:**



**Concerns:**

-  Accounting for revenue and costs: The proposed flexibility in defining subject matter and managing price via change orders creates complexity in determining the total contract price and measuring progress towards completion for revenue recognition under FAS 10.
-  Consistency and comparability: Applying varied interpretations of fixed price and scope definition to similar contracts could impair comparability of financial reporting across entities.

**Recommendations:**

-  Provide detailed accounting guidance on how to apply revenue recognition principles (FAS 10) specifically to Istisna'a contracts for complex intangibles, addressing phased definition, contingencies, and scope changes.
-  Specify disclosure requirements related to the nature of the intangible asset, how the fixed price was determined (e.g., including contingencies), and how scope changes are accounted for.

#### Standards Expert

**Analysis:**



**Concerns:**

- Risk of diluting the fixed price and defined subject matter requirements if proposed flexibilities are not rigorously constrained by Shariah principles for certainty at the point of agreement.
- Potential for ambiguity regarding the application of other relevant standards (e.g., Ijara for maintenance) to distinct project phases or elements.

**Recommendations:**

- Explicitly integrate Shariah requirements for Gharar avoidance within the proposed text defining intangible subject matter and fixed price application, ensuring certainty at contract signing and amendment points.
- Add guidance on the appropriate use and contractual separation of other Shariah contracts (e.g., Ijara) for elements like maintenance or licensing distinct from the Istisna'a construction.

Analysis of \'Well-Defined Subject Matter\' Requirement**\n\n*   **Specific Section/Concept:** Clauses in FAS 10 related to the required characteristics of the subject matter of the Istisna\'a contract, likely stating it must be *described precisely*, *specified clearly*, or be *well-defined* at the time of contract signing.\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The standard\'s wording, likely developed with tangible assets (buildings, machinery, goods) in mind, may not adequately address the nature of complex intangible assets like AI software. Software development, especially for AI, is often an iterative process. The final features, capabilities, performance metrics, and even the underlying technology stack can evolve significantly during development as the client\'s needs are better understood, technical challenges are encountered, or new possibilities emerge. Defining the "subject matter" (the software) *precisely* and *completely* upfront can be extremely difficult, if not impossible, in such projects.\n*   **Why this is an issue in the trigger scenario:** For a large-scale AI platform, the exact specifications might not be fully known or stable at the outset. The project may involve significant R&D components, requiring flexibility in design and features as development progresses. A strict interpretation of "well-defined subject matter" requiring complete upfront specification could render many modern software development projects unsuitable for Istisna\'a under FAS 10, or force artificial and potentially unworkable upfront definitions. This creates uncertainty for financial institutions and clients seeking Shariah-compliant financing for such projects.\n\n**2. Analysis of \'Determination of Cost\' (and Fixed Price) Requirement**\n\n*   **Specific Section/Concept:** Clauses in FAS 10 related to the pricing of the Istisna\'a contract, likely requiring the *price to be fixed* and *determined* at the time the contract is concluded. This requirement is inherently linked to the cost determination for the manufacturer/developer.\n*   **Potential Gap or Ambiguity:** The standard\'s requirement for a fixed price determined upfront poses challenges for complex software development, particularly AI. The cost of developing advanced software can be highly variable due to:\n    *   Unforeseen technical hurdles (e.g., performance issues, integration complexities).\n    *   Difficulty in accurately estimating the effort required for R&D or novel features.\n    *   Changes in scope or requirements that inevitably arise during the development lifecycle.\n    *   Fluctuations in the cost of specialized labor (AI engineers).\n    A fixed price model is often high-risk for the developer in such projects, leading to inflated quotes or reluctance to undertake the project as Istisna\'a. While variations are sometimes allowed in Istisna\'a, the core principle is a fixed price for the *originally agreed-upon* subject matter.\n*   **Why this is an issue in the trigger scenario:** Financing a large-scale AI platform typically involves significant investment. Financial institutions need clarity on how the cost and pricing are determined and managed, especially when the underlying development costs are inherently uncertain. A rigid fixed-price requirement based on potentially inaccurate upfront cost estimations (due to the project\'s complexity and R&D nature) can lead to disputes, project failures, or make the Istisna\'a structure commercially unviable compared to other financing methods that allow for more flexible cost structures (e.g., variations of Murabahah for components, or even service-based models if applicable).

This might include:\n    *   Clarifying how change orders and scope variations impact the determined price in a Shariah-compliant manner.\n    *   Exploring models like phased pricing tied to specific milestones or deliverables.\n    *   Offering guidance on incorporating contingencies within the fixed price or establishing clear protocols for cost adjustments related to unforeseen technical challenges, while maintaining Shariah compliance.\n3.  **Adding Specific Considerations for Intangible Assets:** Include an appendix or specific sections detailing the unique challenges and considerations when applying Istisna\'a principles to intangible assets like software, intellectual property, or digital platforms, differentiating them from tangible goods.\n\nBy addressing these points, FAS 10 could become a more practical and relevant standard for financing modern technological developments, aligning Shariah principles with contemporary business and development practices for complex intangible assets.'}, 'validation_result': 'Okay, acting as the Standards Validator Agent for AAOIFI, I will evaluate the proposed enhancement to FAS 10 based on the provided criteria and information.\n\n**Proposed Enhancement Analysis:**\n\nThe proposed enhancement aims to adapt AAOIFI FAS 10 to the financing of complex intangible assets, specifically AI software development, via Istisna\'a contracts. It addresses the challenges posed by the standard\'s requirements for a \'well-defined subject matter\' and a \'fixed price\' when applied to assets with iterative development and cost uncertainty.\n\nThe proposal consists of three key enhancements:\n1.  **Clarification on Defining Intangible Subject Matter:** Proposes defining intangible subject matter (software, etc.) based on core purpose, functionality, performance benchmarks, acceptance criteria, and deliverables, acknowledging phased definition and iterative refinement within an established overall framework.\n2.  **Addressing Pricing and Cost for Complex Projects:** Reaffirms the fixed price principle but allows for contingencies, phased payments, and requires a formal, Shariah-compliant change management process for scope variations, where the price for changes is agreed upon at the time of the change request.\n3.  **Specific Considerations Section for Intangible Assets:** Proposes a new section outlining specific points for intangible assets, such as defining completion/delivery, inspection/acceptance, intellectual property rights, maintenance/support (as separate), development environment, and confidentiality.\n\n**Validation Checks:**\n\n1.  **Shariah Compliance Assessment:**\n    *   **Riba (Interest):** The proposal does not introduce any element of Riba. The pricing mechanism, while allowing for flexibility in handling changes, maintains the core principle of a determined price for a determined scope at the time of agreement for that scope (original or amended). Phased payments are permissible in Istisna\'a.\n    *   **Gharar (Excessive Uncertainty):** This is the primary Shariah principle challenged by the original issue.\n        *   *Subject Matter:* The original requirement for a "precisely described and well-defined" subject matter (FAS 10, Para 4/1/1) aims to eliminate Gharar about *what* is being manufactured. The proposed Enhancement 1 reinterprets this for intangible assets. Defining by purpose, functionality, performance, deliverables, and acceptance criteria, rather than an exhaustive static list, is a practical way to define software while *still removing excessive uncertainty* about the *intended outcome and core characteristics*. Acknowledging iterative refinement *could* introduce Gharar if not managed. The proposal mitigates this by requiring the overall framework and criteria for subsequent phases to be established upfront. This seems to strike a balance between the need for definition and the reality of software development, aiming to reduce Gharar to an acceptable level for this asset type.\n        *   *Price:* The requirement for a fixed price (FAS 10, Appendix D, comparison with Salam) is also to avoid Gharar in the consideration. Proposed Enhancement 2 explicitly retains the fixed-price principle for the *agreed-upon scope*. The mechanism for handling *scope changes* via a formal process where the price for the *new* scope is agreed *at the time of the change* is crucial for maintaining Shariah compliance. This prevents the contract from being subject to future *undetermined* price adjustments, thereby avoiding Gharar related to the price of the modified work. Contingencies are permissible within a fixed price as long as the total price is agreed. Phased payments are standard in Istisna\'a.\n    *   **Maysir (Gambling):** The proposal does not introduce elements of Maysir. The contract remains tied to the manufacturing/development of a specific asset.\n    *   **Asset-Backing:** The contract is for the creation of a real asset (albeit intangible). The financing is linked to this underlying economic activity.\n    *   **Risk-Sharing:** While Istisna\'a is not a partnership like Musharaka, the manufacturer (Al-Sani\') still bears the risk of manufacturing costs exceeding the fixed price, which is a form of risk-bearing inherent in the contract. The proposal doesn\'t alter this fundamental risk allocation for the original scope. The mechanism for change orders ensures that the price for *additional* work is agreed upon, allocating the risk for *that specific additional work* based on the new agreement.\n    *   **Transparency and Fairness:** The proposed guidance promotes transparency by requiring clear definition criteria, agreed contingencies, formal change management, and specific considerations for intangibles (IP, completion criteria, etc.).\n\n    *Assessment:* The proposed enhancements appear to comply with core Shariah principles by adapting the requirements for subject matter definition and fixed price determination in a manner appropriate for complex intangible assets, while crucially maintaining mechanisms to prevent excessive Gharar.\n\n2.  **Consistency Check:**\n    *   **Internal Consistency with FAS 10:**\n        *   *Subject Matter:* FAS 10 Para 4/1/1 requires specification of kind, type, quality, and quantity. The proposal interprets "specified" or "well-defined" for intangibles by substituting the tangible-centric criteria (kind, quantity) with intangible-centric ones (purpose, functionality, performance, deliverables, acceptance criteria). This is an *extension and interpretation* of the principle, not a contradiction, making the standard applicable to a new asset class.\n        *   *Fixed Price:* FAS 10 implicitly requires a fixed price. The proposal explicitly reaffirms this for the *original scope*. FAS 10 Para 2/5 mentions "Change Orders" and "Additional Claims" and how they affect revenue recognition based on "additional cost". The proposal aligns with the concept of change orders but provides necessary detail on the *Shariah-compliant pricing mechanism* for these changes (agreeing price *at the time of change*), which is essential guidance missing in the current standard regarding Shariah compliance implications of change orders on the fixed price principle.\n        *   *Other Considerations:* The proposed Section Z elaborates on concepts already implicitly or explicitly present in FAS 10 (delivery, inspection, maintenance Para 2/6) and adds necessary points specific to intangibles (IP, confidentiality), enhancing the standard\'s coverage without contradiction.\n    *   **Consistency with Related Standards:**\n        *   FAS 4 (Musharaka) acknowledges intangible assets as capital, showing AAOIFI\'s recognition of such assets.\n        *   FAS 7 (Salam) requires the subject matter (Al-Muslam Fihi) to be "known by specification," similar to Istisna\'a. The proposed method of defining intangible subject matter aligns with this general need for specification, adapted to the asset type.\n        *   The mechanism for handling scope changes by treating them as new agreements or amendments with determined prices at the time of change is consistent with the general principle of contracts requiring clear terms at inception or amendment.\n\n    *Assessment:* The proposed enhancements are consistent with the fundamental principles and existing structure of FAS 10 and related standards. They provide necessary interpretation and practical guidance for a new application area without undermining the core requirements.\n\n3.  **Practical Implementation Assessment:**\n    *   The proposed definitions for intangible subject matter (purpose, performance, deliverables, acceptance criteria) are standard practice in modern software development contracts.\n    *   Acknowledging iterative development and phased definition, linked to upfront framework/criteria, reflects the reality of complex technology projects.\n    *   Allowing contingencies within a fixed price is common commercial practice.\n    *   Structuring phased payments linked to milestones is standard project finance and management practice.\n    *   Implementing a formal change management process where the price for additional scope is agreed upon *at the time of the change* is also a standard, albeit sometimes commercially challenging, practice in fixed-price-like contracts for complex projects.\n    *   The specific considerations in Section Z (completion criteria, IP, etc.) are essential elements of any robust software development contract.\n\n    *Assessment:* The proposed enhancements provide practical, implementable guidance that aligns Istisna\'a with contemporary practices in complex intangible asset development, making the standard usable for financing such projects.\n\n4.  **Final Decision:**\n\nBased on the validation checks:\n*   The proposed enhancements successfully navigate the challenges of applying traditional Istisna\'a requirements to complex intangible assets like AI software.\n*   They maintain compliance with core Shariah principles, particularly by providing a framework to manage Gharar in the subject matter and price for this specific asset class and project type.\n*   They are consistent with the spirit and requirements of FAS 10 and other relevant standards, offering necessary interpretations and practical mechanisms.\n*   The guidance provided is practical and aligns with industry norms for managing complex technology projects.\n\nThe proposal effectively addresses the identified uncertainty and provides a workable framework for applying Istisna\'a to a significant area of modern economic activity.\n\n**Decision:** APPROVED\n\n**Reasoning:** The proposed enhancements demonstrate a careful consideration of both Shariah principles and practical implementation challenges. By interpreting the requirements for \'well-defined subject matter\' and \'fixed price\' in a manner suitable for complex intangible assets and their development lifecycle, while maintaining the underlying Shariah constraints (especially regarding Gharar), the proposal makes FAS 10 applicable to a vital sector of the modern economy. The inclusion of guidance on change management, specific considerations for intangibles, and practical definitions ensures that contracts structured under this enhanced standard will be both Shariah-compliant and commercially viable.'}
